Chapter 1
In the beginning God created heaven, and earth.
2And the earth was void and empty, and
darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the
spirit of God moved over the waters.
3And God said: Be light made. And light
was made.
4And God saw the light that it was good; and
he divided the light from the darkness.
5And he called the light Day, and the dark-
ness Night; and there was evening and morning
one day.
6And God said: Let there be a rmament
made amidst the waters: and let it divide the
waters from the waters.
7And god made a rmament, and divided
the waters that were under the rmament, from
those that were above the rmament, and it was
so.
8And God called the rmament, Heaven; and
the evening and morning were the second day.
9God also said; Let the waters that are under
the heaven, be gathered together into one place:
and let the dry land appear. And it was so done.
10And God called the dry land, Earth; and
the gathering together of the waters, he called
Seas. And God saw that it was good.
11And he said: let the earth bring forth green
herb, and such as may seed, and the fruit tree
yielding fruit after its kind, which may have seed
in itself upon the earth. And it was so done.12And the earth brought forth the green
herb, and such as yieldeth seed according to its
kind, and the tree that beareth fruit, having seed
each one according to its kind. And God saw
that it was good.
13And the evening and the morning were the
third day.
14And God said: Let there be lights made
in the rmament of heaven, to divide the day
and the night, and let them be for signs, and for
seasons, and for days and years:
15To shine in the rmament of heaven, and
to give light upon the earth, and it was so done.
16And God made two great lights: a greater
light to rule the day; and a lesser light to rule
the night: and The stars.
17And he set them in the rmament of heaven
to shine upon the earth.
18And to rule the day and the night, and to
divide the light and the darkness. And God saw
that it was good.
19And the evening and morning were the
fourth day.
20God also said: let the waters bring forth
the creeping creature having life, and the fowl
that may 
y over the earth under the rmament
of heaven.
21And God created the great whales, and
every living and moving creature, which the
waaters brought forth, according to their kinds,
and every winged fowl according to its kind. And
God saw that it was good.
22And he blessed them, saying: Increase and
multiply, and ll the waters of the sea: and let
the birds be multiplied upon the earth.
23And the evening and morning were the fth
day.
24And God said: Let the earth bring forth
the living creature in its kind, cattle and creeping
things, and beasts of the earth, according to their
kinds. And it was so done.
25And God made the beasts of the earth
according to their kinds, and cattle, and every
thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind.
And God saw that it was good.
26And he said: Let us make man to our image
and likeness: and let him have dominion over the
shes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the
beasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping
creature that moveth upon the earth.
27And God created man to his own image:
to the image of God he created him: male and
female he created them.
28And God blessed them, saying: Increase
and multiply, and ll the earth, and subdue it,
and rule over the shes of the sea, and the fowls
of the air, and all living creatures that move
upon the earth.
29And God said: Behold I have given you
every herb bearing seed upon the earth, and all
trees that have in themselves seed of their own
kind, to be your meat:
30And to all beasts of the earth, and to every
fowl of the air, and to all that move upon the
earth, and wherein there is life, that they may
have to feed upon. And it was so done.
31And God saw all the things that he had
made, and they were very good. And the evening
and morning were the sixth day.Chapter 2
So the heavens and the earth were nished, and
all the furniture of them.
2And on the seventh day God ended his work
which he had made: and he rested on the seventh
day from all his work which he had done.
3And he blessed the seventh day, and sancti-
ed it: because in it he had rested from all his
work which God created and made.
4These are the generations of the heaven and
the earth, when they were created, in the day
that the Lord God made the heaven and the
earth:
5And every plant of the eld before it sprung
up in the earth, and every herb of the ground
before it grew: for the Lord God had not rained
upon the earth; and there was not a man to till
the earth.
6But a spring rose out of the earth, watering
all the surface of the earth.
7And the Lord God formed man of the slime
of the earth: and breathed into his face the
breath of life, and man became a living soul.
8And the Lord God had planted a paradise of
pleasure from the beginning: wherein he placed
man whom he had formed.
9And the Lord God brought forth of the
ground all manner of trees, fair to behold, and
pleasant to eat of: the tree of life also in the
midst of paradise: and the tree of knowledge of
good and evil.
10And a river went out of the place of plea-
sure to water paradise, which from thence is di-
vided into four heads.
11The name of the one is Phison: that is it
which compasseth all the land of Hevilath, where
gold groweth.
12And the gold of that land is very good:
there is found bdellium, and the onyx stone.
13And the name of the second river is Gehon:
the same is it that compasseth all the land of
Ethiopia.
14And the name of the third river is Tigris:
the same passeth along by the Assyrians. And
the fourth river is Euphrates.
15And the Lord God took man, and put him
into the paradise of pleasure, to dress it, and to
keep it.
16And he commanded him, saying: Of every
tree of paradise thou shalt eat:
17But of the tree of knowledge of good and
evil, thou shalt not eat. For in what day soever
thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.
18And the Lord God said: It is not good for
man to be alone: let us make him a help like
unto himself.
19And the Lord God having formed out of
the ground all the beasts of the earth, and all
the fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to see
what he would call them: for whatsoever Adam
called any living creature the same is its name.
20And Adam called all the beasts by their
names, and all the fowls of the air, and all the
cattle of the eld: but for Adam there was not
found a helper like himself.
21Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon
Adam: and when he was fast asleep, he took one
of his ribs, and lled up 
esh for it.
22And the Lord God built the rib which he
took from Adam into a woman: and brought her
to Adam.
23And Adam said: This now is bone of my
bones, and 
esh of my 
esh; she shall be called
woman, because she was taken out of man.
24Wherefore a man shall leave father and
mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they
shall be two in one 
esh.
25And they were both naked: to wit, Adam
and his wife: and were not ashamed.Chapter 3
Now the serpent was more subtle tha any of the
beasts of the earth which the Lord God had
made. And he said to the woman: Why hath
God commanded you, that you should not eat
of every tree of paradise?
2And the woman answered him, saying: Of
the fruit of the trees that are in paradise we do
eat:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the
midst of paradise, God hath commanded us that
we should not eat; and that we should not touch
it, lest perhaps we die.
4And the serpent said to the woman: No, you
shall not die the death.
5For God doth know that in what day soever
you shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened:
and you shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.
6And the woman saw that the tree was good
to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to
behold: and she took of the fruit thereof, and
did eat, and gave to her husband, who did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened:
and when they perceived themselves to be naked,
they sewed together g leaves, and made them-
selves aprons.
8And when they heard the voice of the Lord
God walking in paradise at the afternoon air,
Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face
of the Lord God, amidst the trees of paradise.
9And the Lord God called Adam, and said to
him: Where art thou?
10And he said: I heard thy voice in paradise;
and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid
myself.
11And he said to him: And who hath told
thee that thou wast naked, but that thou hast
eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that
thou shouldst not eat?
12And Adam said: The woman, whom thou
gavest me to be my companion, gave me of the
tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said to the woman: Why
hast thou done this? And she answered: The
serpent deceived me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said to the serpent: Be-
cause thou hast done this thing, thou art cursed
among all cattle, and beasts of the earth: upon
thy breast shalt thou go, and earth shalt thou
eat all the days of thy life.
15I will put enmities between thee and the
woman, and thy seed and her seed: she shall
cursh thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her
heel.
16To the woman also he said: I will multi-
ply thy sorrows, and thy conceptions: in sorrow
shalt thou bring forth children, and thou shalt
be under thy husband's power, and he shall have
dominion over thee.
17And to Adam he said: Because thou hast
hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten
of the tree, whereof I commanded thee, that thou
shouldst not eat, cursed is the earth in thy work:
with labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the
days of thy life.
18Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to
thee, and thou shalt eat the herbs of the earth.
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread
till thou return to the earth out of which thou
wast taken: for dust thou art, and into dust thou
shalt return.
20And Adam called the name of his wife Eve:
because she was the mother of all the living.
21And the Lord God made for Adam and his
wife garments of skins, and clothed them.
22And he said: Behold Adam is become as
one of us, knowing good and evil: now therefore
lest perhaps he put forth his hand and take also
of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.23And the Lord God sent him out of the par-
adise of pleasure, to till the earth from which he
was taken.
24And he cast out Adam: and placed before
the paradise of pleasure Cherubims, and a 
am-
ing sword, turning every way, to keep the way of
the tree of life.
Chapter 4
And Adam knew Eve his wife; who conceived
and brought forth Cain, saying: I have gotten a
man through God.
2And again she brought forth his brother
Abel. And Abel was a shepherd, and Cain a
husbandman.
3And it came to pass after many days, that
Cain oered, of the fruits of the earth, gifts to
the Lord.
4Abel also oered of the rstlings of his 
ock,
and of their fat: and the Lord had respect to
Abel, and to his oerings.
5But to Cain and his oerings he had no re-
spect: and Cain was exceeding angry, and his
countenance fell.
6And the Lord said to him: Why art thou
angry? and why is thy countenance fallen?
7If thou do well, shalt thou not receive? but
if ill, shall not sin forthwith be present at the
door? but the lust thereof shall be under thee,
and thou shalt have dominion over it.
8And Cain said to Abel his brother: Let us go
forth abroad. And when they were in the eld,
Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and slew
him.
9And the Lord said to Cain: Where is thy
brother Abel? And he answered: I know not:
am I my brother's keeper?
10And he said to him: What hast thou done?
the voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from
the earth.
11Now therefore cursed shalt thou be upon
the earth, which hath opened her mouth and re-
cieved the blood of thy brother at thy hand.
12When thou shalt till it, it shall not yield
to thee its fruit: a fugitive and a vagabond shalt
thou be upon the earth.
13And Cain said to the Lord: My iniquity is
greater than that I may deserve pardon.
14Behold thou dost cast me out this day from
the face of the earth, and from thy face I shall be
hid, and I shall be a vagabond and a fugitive on
the earth: every one therefore that ndeth me,
shall kill me.
15And the Lord said to him: No, it shall
not so be: but whosoever shall kill Cain, shall
be punished sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark
upon Cain, that whosoever found him should not
kill him.
16And Cain went out from the face of the
Lord, and dwelt as a fugitive on the earth at the
east side of Eden.
17And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived,
and brought forth Henoch: and he built a city,
and called the name thereof by the name of his
son Henoch.
18And Henoch begot Irad, and Irad be-
got Maviael, and Maviael begot Mathusael, and
Mathusael begot Lamech,
19Who took two wives: the name of the one
was Ada, and the name of the other Sella.
20And Ada brought forth Jabel: who was the
father of such as dwell in tents, and of herdsmen.
21And his brother's name was Jubal: he was
the father of them that play upon the harp and
the organs.
22Sella also brought forth Tubalcain, who
was a hammerer and articer in every work ofbrass and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was
Noema.
23And Lamech said to his wives Ada and
Sella: Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hear-
ken to my speech: for I have slain a man to the
wounding of myself, and a stripling to my own
bruising.
24Sevenfold vengeance shall be taken for
Cain: but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold.
25Adam also knew his wife again: and she
brought forth a son, and called his name Seth,
saying: God hath given me another seed for
Abel, whom Cain slew.
26But to Seth also was born a son, whom
he called Enos: this man began to call upon the
name of the Lord.
Chapter 5
This is the book of the generation of Adam. In
the day that God created man, he made him to
the likeness of God.
2He created them male and female; and
blessed them: and called their name Adam, in
the day when they were created.
3And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years,
and begot a son to his own image and likeness,
and called his name Seth.
4And the days of Adam, after he begot Seth,
were eight hundred years: and he begot sons and
daughters.
5And all the time that Adam lived, came to
nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.
6Seth also lived a hundred and ve years, and
begot Enos.
7And Seth lived after he begot Enos, eight
hundred and seven years, and begot sons and
daughters.
8And all the days of Seth were nine hundred
and twelve years, and he died.
9And Enos lived ninety years, and begot
Cainan.
10After whose birth he lived eight hundred
and fteen years, and begot sons and daughters.
11And all the days of Enos were nine hundred
and ve years, and he died.
12And Cainan lived seventy years, and begot
Malaleel.
13And Cainan lived after he begot Malaleel,
eight hundred and forty years, and begot sons
and daughters.
14And all the days of Cainan were nine hun-
dred and ten years, and he died.
15And Malaleel lived sixty-ve years and be-
got Jared.
16And Malaleel lived after he begot Jared,
eight hundred and thirty years, and begot sons
and daughters.
17And all the days of Malaleel were eight
hundred and ninety-ve years, and he died.
18And Jared lived a hundred and sixty-two
years, and begot Henoch.
19And Jared lived after he begot Henoch,
eight hundred years, and begot sons and daugh-
ters.
20And all the days of Jared were nine hun-
dred and sixty-two years, and he died.
21And Henoch lived sixty-ve years, and be-
got Mathusala.
22And Henoch walked with God: and lived
after he begot Mathusala, three hundred years,
and begot sons and daughters.
23And all the days of Henoch were three hun-
dred and sixty-ve years.
24And he walked with God, and was seen no
more: because God took him.
25And Mathusala lived a hundred and eighty-
seven years, and begot Lamech.26And Mathlusala lived after he begot
Lamech, seven hundred and eighty-two years,
and begot sons and daughters.
27And all the days of Mathusala were nine
hundred and sixty-nine years, and he died.
28And Lamech lived a hundred and eighty-
two years, and begot a son.
29And he called his name Noe, saying:
This same shall comfort us from the works and
labours of our hands on the earth, which the
Lord hath cursed.
30And Lamech lived after he begot Noe, ve
hundred and ninety-ve years, and begot sons
and daughters.
31And all the days of Lamech came to seven
hundred and seventy-seven years, and he died.
And Noe, when he was ve hundred years old,
begot Sem, Cham, and Japheth.
Chapter 6
And after that men began to be multiplied upon
the earth, and daughters were born to them,
2The sons of God seeing the daughters of
men, that they were fair, took to themselves
wives of all which they chose.
3And God said: My spirit shall not remain
in man for ever, because he is 
esh, and his days
shall be a hundred and twenty years.
4Now giants were upon the earth in those
days. For after the sons of God went in to the
daughters of men, and they brought forth chil-
dren, these are the mighty men of old, men of
renown.
5And God seeing that the wickedness of men
was great on the earth, and that all the thought
of their heart was bent upon evil at all times,
6It repented him that he had made man on
the earth. And being touched inwardly with sor-
row of heart,
7He said: I will destroy man, whom I have
created, from the face of the earth, from man
even to beasts, from the creeping thing even to
the fowls of the air, for it repenteth me that I
have made them.
8But Noe found grace before the Lord.
9These are the generations of Noe: Noe was
a just and perfect man in his generations, he
walked with God.
10And he begot three sons, Sem, Cham, and
Japheth.
11And the earth was corrupted before God,
and was lled with iniquity.
12And when God had seen that the earth
was corrupted (for all 
esh had corrupted its way
upon the earth),
13He said to Noe: The end of all 
esh is
come before me, the earth is lled with iniquity
through them, and I will destroy them with the
earth.
14Make thee an ark of timber planks: thou
shalt make little rooms in the ark, and thou shalt
pitch it within and without.
15And thus shalt thou make it. The length
of the ark shall be three hundred cubits: the
breadth of it fty cubits, and the height of it
thirty cubits.
16Thou shalt make a window in the ark, and
in a cubit shalt thou nish the top of it: and the
door of the ark thou shalt set in the side: with
lower, middle chambers, and third stories shalt
thou make it.
17Behold, I will bring the waters of a great

ood upon the earth, to destroy all 
esh, wherein
is the breath of life under heaven. All things that
are in the earth shall be consumed.
18And I will establish my covenant with thee,
and thou shalt enter into the ark, thou and thysons, and thy wife, and the wives of thy sons
with thee.
19And of every living creature of all 
esh,
thou shalt bring two of a sort into the ark, that
they may live with thee: of the male sex, and
the female.
20Of fowls according to their kind, and of
beasts in their kind, and of every thing that
creepeth on the earth according to its kind: two
of every sort shall go in with thee, that they may
live.
21Thou shalt take unto thee of all food that
may be eaten, and thou shalt lay it up with thee:
and it shall be food for thee and them.
22And Noe did all things which God com-
manded him.
Chapter 7
And the Lord said to him: Go in, thou and all
thy house, into the ark: for thee I have seen just
before me in this generation.
2Of all clean beasts take seven and seven, the
male and the female.
3But of the beasts that are unclean two and
two, the male and the female. Of the fowls also
of the air seven and seven, the male and the fe-
male: that seed may be saved upon the face of
the whole earth.
4For yet a while, and after seven days, I will
rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights:
and I will destroy every substance that I have
made, from the face of the earth.
5And Noe did all things which the Lord had
commanded him.
6And he was six hundred years old, when the
waters of the 
ood over
owed the earth.
7And Noe went in and his sons, his wife and
the wives of his sons with him into the ark, be-
cause of the waters of the 
ood.
8And of beasts clean and unclean, and of
fowls, and of every thing that moveth upon the
earth,
9Two and two went in to Noe into the ark,
male and female, as the Lord had commanded
Noe.
10And after the seven days were passed, the
waters of the 
ood over
owed the earth.
11In the six hundredth year of the life of Noe,
in the second month, in the seventeenth day of
the month, all the fountains of the great deep
were broken up, and the 
oodgates of heaven
were opened:
12And the rain fell upon the earth forty days
and forty nights.
13In the selfsame day Noe, and Sem, and
Cham, and Japheth, his sons: his wife, and the
three wives of his sons with them, went into the
ark.
14They and every beast according to its kind,
and all the cattle in their kind, and every thing
that moveth upon the earth, according to its
kind, and every fowl according to its kind, all
birds, and all that 
y,
15Went in to Noe into the ark, two and two
of all 
esh, wherein was the breath of life.
16And they that went in, went in male and
female of all 
esh, as God had commanded him:
and the Lord shut him in on the outside.
17And the 
ood was forty days upon the
earth: and the waters increased, and lifted up
the ark on high from the earth.
18For they over
owed exceedingly: and lled
all on the face of the earth: and the ark was
carried upon the waters.
19And the waters prevailed beyond measure
upon the earth: and all the high mountains un-
der the whole heaven were covered.20The water was fteen cubits higher than
the mountains which it covered.
21And all 
esh was destroyed that moved
upon the earth, both of fowl and of cattle, and
of beasts, and of all creeping things that creep
upon the earth: and all men.
22And all things wherein there is the breath
of life on the earth, died.
23And he destroyed all the substance that
was upon the earth, from man even to beast,
and the creeping things and fowls of the air: and
they were destroyed from the earth: and Noe
only remained, and they that were with him in
the ark.
24And the waters prevailed upon the earth a
hundred and fty days.
Chapter 8
And God remembered Noe, and all the living
creatures, and all the cattle which were with him
in the ark, and brought a wind upon the earth,
and the waters were abated:
2The fountains also of the deep, and the

oodgates of heaven, were shut up, and the rain
from heaven was restrained.
3And the waters returned from o the earth
going and coming: and they began to be abated
after a hundred and fty days.
4And the ark rested in the seventh month,
the seven and twentieth day of the month, upon
the mountains of Armenia.
5And the waters were going and decreasing
until the tenth month: for in the tenth month,
the rst day of the month, the tops of the moun-
tains appeared.
6And after that forty days were passed, Noe
opening the window of the ark, which he had
made, sent forth a raven:
7Which went forth and did not return, till the
waters were dried up upon the earth.
8He sent forth also a dove after him, to see if
the waters had now ceased upon the face of the
earth.
9But she not nding where her foot might
rest, returned to him into the ark: for the waters
were upon the whole earth: and he put forth his
hand, and caught her, and brought her into the
ark.
10And having waited yet seven other days,
he again sent forth the dove out of the ark.
11And she came to him in the evening carry-
ing a bough of an olive tree, with green leaves, in
her mouth. Noe therefore understood that the
waters were ceased upon the earth.
12And he stayed yet other seven days: and
he sent forth the dove, which returned not any
more unto him.
13Therefore in the six hundredth and rst
year, the rst month, the rst day of the month,
the waters were lessened upon the earth, and
Noe opening the covering of the ark, looked, and
saw that the face of the earth was dried.
14In the second month, the seven and twen-
tieth day of the month, the earth was dried.
15And God spoke to Noe, saying:
16Go out of the ark, thou and thy wife, thy
sons and the wives of thy sons with thee.
17All living things that are with thee of all

esh, as well in fowls as in beasts, and all creep-
ing things that creep upon the earth, bring out
with thee, and go ye upon the earth: increase
and multiply upon it.
18So Noe went out, he and his sons: his wife,
and the wives of his sons with him.
19And all living things, and cattle, and creep-
ing things that creep upon the earth, according
to their kinds went out of the ark.20And Noe built an altar unto the Lord: and
taking of all cattle and fowls that were clean,
oered holocausts upon the altar.
21And the Lord smelled a sweet savour, and
said: I will no more curse the earth for the sake of
man: for the imagination and thought of man's
heart are prone to evil from his youth: therefore
I will no more destroy every living soul as I have
done.
22All the days of the earth, seedtime and har-
vest, cold and heat, summer and winter, night
and day, shall not cease.
Chapter 9
And God blessed Noe and his sons. And he
said to them: Increase, and multiply, and ll the
earth.
2And let the fear and dread of you be upon
all the beasts of the earth, and upon all the fowls
of the air, and all that move upon the earth: all
the shes of the sea are delivered into your hand.
3And every thing that moveth, and liveth
shall be meat for you: even as the green herbs
have I delivered them all to you:
4Saving that 
esh with blood you shall not
eat.
5For I will require the blood of your lives at
the hand of every beast, and at the hand of man,
at the hand of every man, and of his brother, will
I require the life of man.
6Whosoever shall shed man's blood, his blood
shall be shed: for man was made to the image of
God.
7But increase you and multiply, and go upon
the earth and ll it.
8Thus also said God to Noe, and to his sons
with him:
9Behold I will establish my covenant with
you, and with your seed after you:
10And with every living soul that is with you,
as well in all birds, as in cattle and beasts of the
earth, that are come forth out of the ark, and in
all the beasts of the earth.
11I will establish my covenant with you, and
all 
esh shall be no more destroyed with the wa-
ters of a 
ood, neither shall there be from hence-
forth a 
ood to waste the earth.
12And God said: This is the sign of the
covenant which I give between me and you, and
to every living soul that is with you, for perpet-
ual generations.
13I will set my bow in the clouds, and it shall
be the sign of a covenant between me and be-
tween the earth.
14And when I shall cover the sky with clouds,
my bow shall appear in the clouds:
15And I will remember my covenant with
you, and with every living soul that beareth

esh: and there shall no more be waters of a

ood to destroy all 
esh.
16And the bow shall be in the clouds, and I
shall see it, and shall remember the everlasting
covenant, that was made between God and every
living soul of all 
esh which is upon the earth.
17And God said to Noe: This shall be the
sign of the covenant, which I have established,
between me and all 
esh upon the earth.
18And the sons of Noe, who came out of the
ark, were Sem, Cham, and Japheth: and Cham
is the father of Chanaan.
19These three are the sons of Noe: and from
these was all mankind spread over the whole
earth.
20And Noe a husbandman began to till the
ground, and planted a vineyard.
21And drinking of the wine was made drunk,
and was uncovered in his tent.22Which when Cham the father of Chanaan
had seen, to wit, that his father's nakedness was
uncovered, he told it to his two brethren without.
23But Sem and Japheth put a cloak upon
their shoulders, and going backward, covered the
nakedness of their father: and their faces were
turned away, and they saw not their father's
nakedness.
24And Noe awaking from the wine, when he
had learned what his younger son had done to
him,
25He said: Cursed be Chanaan, a servant of
servants shall he be unto his brethren.
26And he said: Blessed be the Lord God of
Sem, be Chanaan his servant.
27May God enlarge Japheth, and may he
dwell in the tents of Sem, and Chanaan be his
servant.
28And Noe lived after the 
ood three hun-
dred and fty years.
29And all his days were in the whole nine
hundred and fty years: and he died.
Chapter 10
These are the generations of the sons of Noe:
Sem, Cham, and Japheth: and unto them sons
were born after the 
ood.
2The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog,
and Madai, and Javan, and Thubal, and Mosoch,
and Thiras.
3And the sons of Gomer: Ascenez and
Riphath and Thogorma.
4And the sons of Javan: Elisa and Tharsis,
Cetthim and Dodanim.
5By these were divided the islands of the Gen-
tiles in their lands, every one according to his
tongue and their families in their nations.
6And the Sons of Cham: Chus, and Mesram,
and Phuth, and Chanaan.
7And the sons of Chus: Saba, and Hevila,
and Sabatha, and Regma, and Sabatacha. The
sons of Regma: Saba, and Dadan.
8Now Chus begot Nemrod: he began to be
mighty on the earth.
9And he was a stout hunter before the Lord.
Hence came a proverb: Even as Nemrod the
stout hunter before the Lord.
10And the beginning of his kingdom was
Babylon, and Arach, and Achad, and Chalanne
in the land of Sennaar.
11Out of that land came forth Assur, and
built Ninive, and the streets of the city, and
Chale.
12Resen also between Ninive and Chale: this
is the great city.
13And Mesraim begot Ludim, and Anamim
and Laabim, Nephthuim.
14And Phetrusim, and Chasluim; of whom
came forth the Philistines, and the Capthorim.
15And Chanaan begot Sidon his rstborn,
the Hethite,
16And the Jebusite, and the Amorrhite, and
the Gergesite.
17The Hevite and Aracite: the Sinite,
18And the Aradian, the Samarite, and the
Hamathite: and afterwards the families of the
Chanaanites were spread abroad.
19And the limits of Chanaan were from Sidon
as one comes to Gerara even to Gaza, until thou
enter Sodom and Gomorrha, and Adama, and
Seboim even to Lesa.
20These are the children of Cham in their kin-
dreds and tongues, and generations, and lands,
and nations.
21Of Sem also the father of all the children of
Heber, the elder brother of Japheth, sons were
born.22The sons of Sem: Elam and Assur, and
Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.
23The sons of Aram: Us, and Hull, and
Gether; and Mes.
24But Arphaxad begot Sale, of whom was
born Heber.
25And to Heber were born two sons: the
name of the one was Phaleg, because in his days
was the earth divided: and his brother's name
Jectan.
26Which Jectan begot Elmodad, and Saleph,
and Asarmoth, Jare,
27And Aduram, and Uzal, and Decla,
28And Ebal, and Abimael, Saba,
29And Ophir, and Hevila, and Jobab. All
these were the sons of Jectan.
30And their dwelling was from Messa as we
go on as far as Sephar, a mountain in the east.
31These are the children of Sem according
to their kindreds and tongues, and countries in
their nations.
32These are the families of Noe, according
to their people and nations. By these were the
nations divided on the earth after the 
ood.
Chapter 11
And the earth was of one tongue, and of the same
speech.
2And when they removed from the east, they
found a plain in the land of Sennaar, and dwelt
in it.
3And each one said to his neighbour: Come
let us make brick, and bake them with re. And
they had brick instead of stones, and slime in-
stead of mortar:
4And they said: Come, let us make a city and
a tower, the top whereof may reach to heaven;
and let us make our name famous before we be
scattered abroad into all lands.
5And the Lord came down to see the city
and the tower, which the children of Adam were
building.
6And he said: Behold, it is one people, and all
have one tongue: and they have begun to do this,
neither will they leave o from their designs, till
they accomplish them in deed.
7Come ye, therefore, let us go down, and
there confound their tongue, that they may not
understand one another's speech.
8And so the Lord scattered them from that
place into all lands, and they ceased to build the
city.
9And therefore the name thereof was called
Babel, because there the language of the whole
earth was confounded: and from thence the Lord
scattered them abroad upon the face of all coun-
tries.
10These are the generations of Sem: Sem was
a hundred years old when he begot Arphaxad,
two years after the 
ood.
11And Sem lived after he begot Arphaxad,
ve hundred years, and begot sons and daugh-
ters.
12And Arphaxad lived thirty-ve years, and
begot Sale.
13And Arphaxad lived after he begot Sale,
three hundred and three years, and begot sons
and daughters.
14Sale also lived thirty years, and begot
Heber.
15And Sale lived after he begot Heber, four
hundred and three years: and begot sons and
daughters.
16And Heber lived thirty-four years, and be-
got Phaleg.
17And Heber lived after he begot Phaleg, four
hundred and thirty years: and begot sons anddaughters.
18Phaleg also lived thirty years, and begot
Reu.
19And Phaleg lived after he begot Reu, two
hundred and nine years, and begot sons and
daughters.
20And Reu lived thirty-two years, and begot
Sarug.
21And Reu lived after he begot Sarug, two
hundred and seven years, and begot sons and
daughters.
22And Sarug lived thirty years, and begot
Nachor.
23And Sarug lived after he begot Nachor, two
hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.
24And Nachor lived nine and twenty years,
and begot Thare.
25And Nachor lived after he begot Thare, a
hundred and nineteen years, and begot sons and
daughters.
26And Thare lived seventy years, and begot
Abram, and Nachor, and Aran.
27And these are the generations of Thare:
Thare begot Abram, Nachor, and Aran. And
Aran begot Lot.
28And Aran died before Thare his father, in
the land of his nativity in Ur of the Chaldees.
29And Abram and Nachor married wives: the
name of Abram's wife was Sarai: and the name
of Nachor's wife, Melcha, the daughter of Aran,
father of Melcha and father of Jescha.
30And Sarai was barren, and had no children.
31And Thare took Abram his son, and Lot
the son of Aran, his son's son, and Sarai his
daughter in law, the wife of Abram his son, and
brought them out of Ur of the Chaldees, to go
into the land of Chanaan: and they came as far
as Haran, and dwelt there.
32And the days of Thare were two hundred
and ve years, and he died in Haran.
Chapter 12
And the Lord said to Abram: Go forth out of
thy country, and from thy kindred, and out of
thy father's house, and come into the land which
I shall shew thee.
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I
will bless thee, and magnify thy name, and thou
shalt be blessed.
3I will bless them that bless thee, and curse
them that curse thee, and IN THEE shall all the
kindreds of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram went out as the Lord had com-
manded him, and Lot went with him: Abram
was seventy-ve years old when he went forth
from Haran.
5And he took Sarai his wife, and Lot his
brother's son, and all the substance which they
had gathered, and the souls which they had got-
ten in Haran: and they went out to go into the
land of Chanaan. And when they were come into
it,
6Abram passed through the country unto the
place of Sichem, as far as the noble vale: now
the Chanaanite was at that time in the land.
7And the Lord appeared to Abram, and said
to him: To thy seed will I give this land. And
he built there an altar to the Lord, who had ap-
peared to him.
8And passing on from thence to a mountain,
that was on the east side of Bethel, he there
pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and
Hai on the east: he built there also an altar to
the Lord, and called upon his name.
9And Abram went forward, going and pro-
ceeding on to the south.
10And there came a famine in the country:
and Abram went down into Egypt, to sojourn
there: for the famine was very grievous in the
land.11And when he was near to enter into Egypt,
he said to Sarai his wife: I know that thou art a
beautiful woman:
12And that when the Egyptians shall see
thee, they will say: She is his wife: and they
will kill me, and keep thee.
13Say, therefore, I pray thee, that thou art
my sister: that I may be well used for thee, and
that my soul may live for thy sake.
14And when Abram was come into Egypt,
the Egyptians saw the woman that she was very
beautiful.
15And the princes told Pharao, and praised
her before him: and the woman was taken into
the house of Pharao.
16And they used Abram well for her sake.
And he had sheep and oxen and he asses, and
men servants, and maid servants, and she asses,
and camels.
17But the Lord scourged Pharao and his
house with most grievous stripes for Sarai,
Abram's wife.
18And Pharao called Abram, and said to him:
What is this that thou hast done to me? Why
didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19For what cause didst thou say, she was thy
sister, that I might take her to my wife? Now
therefore there is thy wife, take her, and go thy
way.
20And Pharao gave his men orders concern-
ing Abram: and they led him away and his wife,
and all that he had.
Chapter 13
And Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his
wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him into
the south.
2And he was very rich in possession of gold
and silver.
3And he returned by the way, that he came,
from the south to Bethel, to the place where be-
fore he had pitched his tent between Bethel and
Hai,
4In the place of the altar which he had made
before, and there he called upon the name of the
Lord.
5But Lot also, who was with Abram, had

ocks of sheep, and herds of beasts, and tents.
6Neither was the land able to bear them, that
they might dwell together: for their substance
was great, and they could not dwell together.
7Whereupon also there arose a strife between
the herdsmen of Abram and of Lot. And at that
time the Chanaanite and the Pherezite dwelled
in that country.
8Abram therefore said to Lot: Let there be
no quarrel, I beseech thee, between me and thee,
and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen:
for we are brethren.
9Behold the whole land is before thee: depart
from me, I pray thee: if thou wilt go to the left
hand, I will take the right: if thou choose the
right hand, I will pass to the left.
10And Lot lifting up his eyes, saw all the
country about the Jordan, which was watered
throughout, before the Lord destroyed Sodom
and Gomorrha, as the paradise of the Lord, and
like Egypt as one comes to Segor.
11And Lot chose to himself the country about
the Jordan, and he departed from the east: and
they were separated one brother from the other.
12Abram dwelt in the land of Chanaan: and
Lot abode in the towns, that were about the Jor-
dan, and dwelt in Sodom.
13And the men of Sodom were very wicked,
and sinners before the face of the Lord beyond
measure.14And the Lord said to Abram, after Lot
was separated from him: Lift up thy eyes, and
look from the place wherein thou now art, to the
north and to the south, to the east and to the
west.
15All the land which thou seest, I will give to
thee, and to thy seed for ever.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the
earth: if any man be able to number the dust of
the earth, he shall be able to number thy seed
also.
17Arise and walk through the land in the
length, and the breadth thereof: for I will give it
to thee.
18So Abram removing his tent, came, and
dwelt by the vale of Mambre, which is in Hebron:
and he built there an altar to the Lord.
Chapter 14
And it came to pass at that time, that Amraphel,
king of Sennaar, and Arioch, king of Pontus,
and Chodorlahomor, king of the Elamites, and
Thadal, king of nations,
2Made war against Bara, king of Sodom, and
against Bersa, king of Gomorrha, and against
Sennaab, king of Adama, and against Semeber,
king of Seboim, and against the king of Bala,
which is Segor.
3All these came together into the woodland
vale, which now is the salt sea.
4For they had served Chodorlahomor twelve
years, and in the thirteenth year they revolted
from him.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chodorla-
homor, and the kings that were with him: and
they smote the Raphaim in Astarothcarnaim,
and the Zuzim with them, and the Emim in Save
of Cariathaim.
6And the Chorreans in the mountains of Seir,
even to the plains of Pharan, which is in the
wilderness.
7And they returned, and came to the foun-
tain of Misphat, the same is Cades: and they
smote all the country of the Amalecites, and the
Amorrhean that dwelt in Asasonthamar.
8And the king of Sodom, and the king of Go-
morrha, and the king of Adama, and the king
of Seboim, and the king of Bala, which is Segor,
went out: and they set themselves against them
in battle array, in the woodland vale:
9To wit, against Chodorlahomor king of the
Elamites, and Thadal king of nations, and Am-
raphel king of Sennaar, and Arioch king of Pon-
tus: four kings against ve.
10Now the woodland vale had many pits of
slime. And the king of Sodom, and the king
of Gomorrha turned their backs, and were over-
thrown there: and they that remained, 
ed to
the mountain.
11And they took all the substance of the
Sodomites, and Gomorrhites, and all their vict-
uals, and went their way:
12And Lot also, the son of Abram's brother,
who dwelt in Sodom, and his substance.
13And behold one, that had escaped, told
Abram the Hebrew, who dwelt in the vale of
Mambre the Amorrhite, the brother of Escol,
and the brother of Aner: for these had made
a league with Abram.
14Which when Abram had heard, to wit, that
his brother Lot was taken, he numbered of the
servants born in his house, three hundred and
eighteen, well appointed: and pursued them to
Dan.
15And dividing his company, he rushed upon
them in the night, and defeated them: and pur-
sued them as far as Hoba, which is on the left
hand of Damascus.16And he brought back all the substance, and
Lot his brother, with his substance, the women
also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet
him, after he returned from the slaughter of
Chodorlahomor, and of the kings that were with
him in the vale of Save, which is the king's vale.
18But Melchisedech, the king of Salem, bring-
ing forth bread and wine, for he was the priest
of the most high God,
19Blessed him, and said: Blessed be Abram
by the most high God, who created heaven and
earth.
20And blessed be the most high God, by
whose protection, the enemies are in thy hands.
And he gave him the tithes of all.
21And the king of Sodom said to Abram:
Give me the persons, and the rest take to thyself.
22And he answered him: I lift up my hand
to the Lord God the most high, the possessor of
heaven and earth,
23That from the very woofthread unto the
shoe latchet, I will not take of any things that
are thine, lest thou say: I have enriched Abram.
24Except such things as the young men have
eaten, and the shares of the men that came with
me, Aner, Escol, and Mambre: these shall take
their shares.
Chapter 15
Now when these things were done, the word of
the Lord came to Abram by a vision, saying:
Fear not, Abram, I am thy protector, and thy
reward exceeding great.
2And Abram said: Lord God, what wilt thou
give me? I shall go without children: and the
son of the steward of my house is this Damascus
Eliezer.
3And Abram added: But to me thou hast not
given seed: and lo my servant born in my house,
shall be my heir.
4And immediately the word of the Lord came
to him, saying : He shall not be thy heir: but
he that shall come out of thy bowels, him shalt
thou have for thy heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said
to him: Look up to heaven and number the stars
if thou canst. And he said to him: So shall thy
seed be.
6Abram believed God, and it was reputed to
him unto justice.
7And he said to him: I am the Lord who
brought thee out from Ur of the Chaldees, to give
thee this land, and that thou mightest possess it.
8But he said: Lord God, whereby may I know
that I shall possess it?
9And the Lord answered, and said: Take me
a cow of three years old, and a she goat of three
years. and a ram of three years, a turtle also,
and a pigeon.
10And he took all these, and divided them
in the midst, and laid the two pieces of each one
against the other: but the birds he divided not.
11And the fowls came down upon the car-
casses, and Abram drove them away.
12And when the sun was setting, a deep sleep
fell upon Abram, and a great and darksome hor-
ror seized upon him.
13And it was said unto him: Know thou be-
forehand that thy seed shall be a stranger in a
land not their own, and they shall bring them
under bondage, and aict them four hundred
years.
14But I will judge the nation which they shall
serve, and after this they shall come out with
great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace,
and be buried in a good old age.16But in the fourth generation they shall re-
turn hither: for as yet the iniquities of the Amor-
rhites are not at the full until this present time.
17And when the sun was set, there arose a
dark mist, and there appeared a smoking fur-
nace, and a lamp of re passing between those
divisions.
18That day God made a covenant with
Abram, saying: To thy seed will I give this land,
from the river to Egypt even to the great river
Euphrates.
19The Cineans, and Cenezites, the Ced-
monites,
20And the Hethites, and the Pherezites, the
Raphaim also,
21And the Amorrhites, and the Chanaanites,
and the Gergesites, and the Jebusites.
Chapter 16
Now Sarai, the wife of Abram, had brought forth
no children: but having a handmaid, an Egyp-
tian, named Agar,
2She said to her husband: Behold, the Lord
hath restrained me from bearing: go in unto my
handmaid, it may be I may have children of her
at least. And when he agreed to her request,
3She took Agar the Egyptian her handmaid,
ten years after they rst dwelt in the land of
Chanaan, and gave her to her husband to wife.
4And he went in to her. But she perceiving
that she was with child, despised her mistress.
5And Sarai said to Abram: Thou dost un-
justly with me: I gave my handmaid into thy bo-
som, and she perceiving herself to be with child,
despiseth me. The Lord judge between me and
thee.
6And Abram made answer, and said to her:
Behold thy handmaid is in thy own hand, use
her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai aicted
her, she ran away.
7And the angel of the Lord having found her,
by a fountain of water in the wilderness, which
is in the way to Sur in the desert,
8He said to her: Agar, handmaid of Sarai,
whence comest thou? and whither goest thou?
And she answered: I 
ee from the face of Sarai,
my mistress.
9And the angel of the Lord said to her: Re-
turn to thy mistress, and humble thyself under
her hand.
10And again he said: I will multiply thy seed
exceedingly, and it shall not be numbered for
multitude.
11And again: Behold, said he, thou art with
child, and thou shalt bring forth a son: and thou
shalt call his name Ismael, because the Lord hath
heard thy aiction.
12He shall be a wild man: his hand will be
against all men, and all men's hands against him:
and he shall pitch his tents over against all his
brethren.
13And she called the name of the Lord that
spoke unto her: Thou the God who hast seen
me. For she said: Verily, here have I seen the
hinder parts of him that seeth me.
14Therefore she called that well, the well of
him that liveth and seeth me. The same is be-
tween Cades and Barad.
15And Agar brought forth a son to Abram:
who called his name Ismael.
16Abram was four score and six years old
when Agar brought him forth Ismael.
Chapter 17
And after he began to be ninety and nine years
old, the Lord appeared to him: and said untohim: I am the Almighty God: walk before me,
and be perfect.
2And I will make my covenant between me
and thee: and I will multiply thee exceedingly.
3Abram fell 
at on his face.
4And God said to him: I am, and my
covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a fa-
ther of many nations.
5Neither shall thy name be called any more
Abram: but thou shalt be called Abraham: be-
cause I have made thee a father of many nations.
6And I will make thee increase exceedingly,
and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall
come out of thee.
7And I will establish my covenant between
me and thee, and between thy seed after thee in
their generations, by a perpetual covenant: to
be a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee.
8And I will give to thee, and to thy seed,
the land of thy sojournment, all the land of
Chanaan, for a perpetual possession, and I will
be their God.
9Again God said to Abraham: And thou
therefore shalt keep my covenant, and thy seed
after thee in their generations.
10This is my covenant which you shall ob-
serve between me and you, and thy seed after
thee: All the male kind of you shall be circum-
cised.
11And you shall circumcise the 
esh of your
foreskin, that it may be for a sign of the covenant
between me and you.
12An infant of eight days old shall be circum-
cised among you, every manchild in your genera-
tions: he that is born in the house, as well as the
bought servant, shall be circumcised, and whoso-
ever is not of your stock:
13And my covenant shall be in your 
esh for
a perpetual covenant.
14The male whose 
esh of his foreskin shall
not be circumcised, that soul shall be destroyed
out of his people: because he hath broken my
covenant.
15God said also to Abraham: Sarai thy wife
thou shalt not call Sarai, but Sara.
16And I will bless her, and of her I will give
thee a son, whom I will bless, and he shall be-
come nations, and kings of people shall spring
from him.
17Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed,
saying in his heart: Shall a son, thinkest thou,
be born to him that is a hundred years old? and
shall Sara that is ninety years old bring forth?
18And he said to God: O that Ismael may
live before thee.
19And God said to Abraham: Sara thy wife
shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his
name Isaac, and I will establish my covenant
with him for a perpetual covenant, and with his
seed after him.
20And as for Ismael I have also heard thee.
Behold, I will bless him, and increase, and multi-
ply him exceedingly: he shall beget twelve chiefs,
and I will make him a great nation.
21But my covenant I will establish with Isaac,
whom Sara shall bring forth to thee at this time
in the next year.
22And when he had left o speaking with
him, God went up from Abraham.
23And Abraham took Ismael his son, and
all that were born in his house: and all whom
he had bought, every male among the men of
his house: and he circumcised the 
esh of their
foreskin forthwith the very same day, as God had
commanded him.
24Abraham was ninety and nine years old,
when he circumcised the 
esh of his foreskin.
25And Ismael his son was full thirteen years
old at the time of his circumcision.26The selfsame day was Abraham circum-
cised and Ismael his son.
27And all the men of his house, as well they
that were born in his house, as the bought ser-
vants and strangers, were circumcised with him.
Chapter 18
And the Lord appeared to him in the vale of
Mambre as he was sitting at the door of his tent,
in the very heat of the day.
2And when he had lifted up his eyes, there
appeared to him three men standing near to him:
and as soon as he saw them, he ran to meet them
from the door of his tent, and adored down to
the ground.
3And he said: Lord, if I have found favour in
thy sight, pass not away from thy servant.
4But I will fetch a little water, and wash ye
your feet, and rest ye under the tree.
5And I will set a morsel of bread, and
strengthen ye your heart, afterwards you shall
pass on: for therefore are you come aside to your
servant. And they said: Do as thou hast spoken.
6Abraham made haste into the tent to Sara,
and said to her: Make haste, temper together
three measures of 
our, and make cakes upon
the hearth.
7And he himself ran to the herd, and took
from thence a calf, very tender and very good,
and gave it to a young man, who made haste and
boiled it.
8He took also butter and milk, and the calf
which he had boiled, and set before them: but
he stood by them under the tree.
9And when they had eaten, they said to him:
Where is Sara thy wife? He answered: Lo she is
in the tent.
10And he said to him: I will return and come
to thee at this time, life accompanying, and Sara,
thy wife, shall have a son. Which when Sara
heard, she laughed behind the door of the tent.
11Now they were both old, and far advanced
in years, and it had ceased to be with Sara after
the manner of women.
12And she laughed secretly, saying: After I
am grown old, and my lord is an old man, shall
I give myself to pleasure?
13And the Lord said to Abraham: Why did
Sara laugh, saying: Shall I, who am an old
woman, bear a child indeed?
14Is there any thing hard to God? According
to appointment I will return to thee at this same
time, life accompanying, and Sara shall have a
son.
15Sara denied, saying: I did not laugh: for
she was afraid. But the Lord said: Nay; but thou
didst laugh.
16And when the men rose up from thence,
they turned their eyes towards Sodom: and
Abraham walked with them, bringing them on
the way.
17And the Lord said: Can I hide from Abra-
ham what I am about to do:
18Seeing he shall become a great and mighty
nation, and in him all the nations of the earth
shall be blessed?
19For I know that he will command his chil-
dren, and his household after him, to keep the
way of the Lord, and do judgment and justice:
that for Abraham's sake, the Lord may bring to
eect all the things he hath spoken unto him.
20And the Lord said: The cry of Sodom and
Gomorrha is multiplied, and their sin is become
exceedingly grievous.
21I will go down and see whether they have
done according to the cry that is come to me; or
whether it be not so, that I may know.
22And they turned themselves from thence,and went their way to Sodom: but Abraham as
yet stood before the Lord.
23And drawing nigh, he said: Wilt thou de-
stroy the just with the wicked?
24If there be fty just men in the city, shall
they perish withal? and wilt thou not spare that
place for the sake of the fty just, if they be
therein?
25Far be it from thee to do this thing, and to
slay the just with the wicked, and for the just to
be in like case as the wicked; this is not beseem-
ing thee: thou who judgest all the earth, wilt not
make this judgment.
26And the Lord said to him: If I nd in
Sodom fty just within the city, I will spare the
whole place for their sake.
27And Abraham answered, and said: See-
ing I have once begun, I will speak to my Lord,
whereas I am dust and ashes.
28What if there be ve less than fty just
persons? wilt thou for ve and forty destroy the
whole city: And he said: I will not destroy it, if
I nd ve and forty.
29And again he said to him: But if forty be
found there, what wilt thou do? He said: I will
not destroy it for the sake of forty.
30Lord, saith he, be not angry, I beseech thee,
if I speak: What if thirty shall be found there?
He answered: I will not do it, if I nd thirty
there.
31Seeing, saith he, I have once begun, I will
speak to my Lord: What if twenty be found
there? He said: I will not destroy it for the sake
of twenty.
32I beseech thee, saith he, be not angry, Lord,
if I speak yet once more: What if ten shall be
found there? And he said: I will not destroy it
for the sake of ten.
33And the Lord departed, after he had left
speaking to Abraham: and Abraham returned
to his place.
Chapter 19
And the two angels came to Sodom in the
evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of the
city. And seeing them, he rose up and went
to meet them: and worshipped prostrate to the
ground.
2And said: I beseech you, my lords, turn in
to the house of your servant, and lodge there:
wash your feet, and in the morning you shall go
on your way. And they said: No, but we will
abide in the street.
3He pressed them very much to turn in unto
him: and when they were come into his house, he
made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread,
and they ate:
4But before they went to bed, the men of the
city beset the house, both young and old, all the
people together.
5And they called Lot, and said to him: Where
are the men that came in to thee at night? bring
them out hither, that we may know them:
6Lot went out to them, and shut the door
after him, and said:
7Do not so, I beseech you, my brethren, do
not commit this evil.
8I have two daughters who, as yet, have not
known man; I will bring them out to you, and
abuse you them as it shall please you, so that
you do no evil to these men, because they are
come in under the shadow of my roof.
9But they said: Get thee back thither. And
again: Thou camest in, said they, as a stranger,
was it to be a judge? therefore we will aict
thee more than them. And they pressed very
violently upon Lot: and they were even at the
point of breaking open the doors.10And behold the men put out their hand,
and drew in Lot unto them, and shut the door.
11And them, that were without, they struck
with blindness from the least to the greatest, so
that they could not nd the door.
12And they said to Lot: Hast thou here any
of thine? son in law, or sons, or daughters, all
that are thine bring them out of this city:
13For we will destroy this place, because their
cry is grown loud before the Lord, who hath sent
us to destroy them.
14So Lot went out, and spoke to his sons
in law that were to have his daughters, and said:
Arise: get you out of this place, because the Lord
will destroy this city. And he seemed to them to
speak as it were in jest.
15And when it was morning, the angels
pressed him, saying: Arise, take thy wife, and
the two daughters that thou hast: lest thou also
perish in the wickedness of the city.
16And as he lingered, they took his hand, and
the hand of his wife, and of his two daughters,
because the Lord spared him.
17And they brought him forth, and set him
without the city: and there they spoke to him,
saying: Save thy life: look not back, neither stay
thou in all the country about: but save thy self
in the mountain, lest thou be also consumed.
18And Lot said to them: I beseech thee, my
Lord,
19Because thy servant hath found grace be-
fore thee, and thou hast magnied thy mercy,
which thou hast shewn to me, in saving my life,
and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some
evil seize me, and I die.
20There is this city here at hand, to which I
may 
ee, it is a little one, and I shall be saved in
it: is it not a little one, and my soul shall live?
21And he said to him: Behold also in this, I
have heard thy prayers, not to destroy the city
for which thou hast spoken.
22Make haste, and be saved there: because
I cannot do any thing till thou go in thither.
Therefore the name of that city was called Segor.
23The sun was risen upon the earth, and Lot
entered into Segor.
24And the Lord rained upon Sodom and Go-
morrha brimstone and re from the Lord out of
heaven.
25And he destroyed these cities, and all the
country about, all the inhabitants of the cities,
and all things that spring from the earth.
26And his wife looking behind her, was
turned into a statue of salt.
27And Abraham got up early in the morning,
and in the place where he had stood before with
the Lord:
28He looked towards Sodom and Gomorrha,
and the whole land of that country: and he saw
the ashes rise up from the earth as the smoke of
a furnace.
29Now when God destroyed the cities of that
country, remembering Abraham, he delivered
Lot out of the destruction of the cities wherein
he had dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Segor, and abode
in the mountain, and his two daughters with him
(for he was afraid to stay in Segor) and he dwelt
in a cave, he and his two daughters with him.
31And the elder said to the younger: Our
father is old, and there is no man left on the
earth, to come in unto us after the manner of
the whole earth.
32Come, let us make him drunk with wine,
and let us lie with him, that we may preserve
seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that
night: and the elder went in, and lay with her
father: but he perceived not, neither when his
daughter lay down, nor when she rose up.34And the next day the elder said to the
younger: Behold I lay last night with my father,
let us make him drink wine also to night, and
thou shalt lie with him, that we may save seed
of our father.
35They made their father drink wine that
night also, and the younger daughter went in,
and lay with him: and neither then did he per-
ceive when she lay down, nor when she rose up.
36So the two daughters of Lot were with child
by their father.
37And the elder bore a son, and she called
his name Moab: he is the father of the Moabites
unto this day.
38The younger also bore a son, and she called
his name Ammon; that is, the son of my people:
he is the father of the Ammonites unto this day.
Chapter 20
Abraham removed from thence to the south
country, and dwelt between Cades and Sur, and
sojourned in Gerara.
2And he said of Sara his wife: She is my sister.
So Abimelech the king of Gerara sent, and took
her.
3And God came to Abimelech in a dream by
night, and he said to him: Lo thou shalt die for
the woman that thou hast taken: for she hath a
husband.
4Now Abimelech had not touched her, and
he said: Lord, wilt thou slay a nation that is
ignorant and just?
5Did not he say to me: She is my sister: and
she say, He is my brother? in the simplicity of
my heart, and cleanness of my hands have I done
this.
6And God said to him: And I know that
thou didst it with a sincere heart: and therefore
I withheld thee from sinning against me, and I
suered thee not to touch her.
7Now therefore restore the man his wife, for
he is a prophet: and he shall pray for thee, and
thou shalt live: but if thou wilt not restore her,
know that thou shalt surely die, thou and all
that are thine.
8And Abimelech forthwith rising up in the
night, called all his servants: and spoke all these
words in their hearing, and all the men were ex-
ceedingly afraid.
9And Abimelech called also for Abraham, and
said to him: What hast thou done to us? what
have we oended thee in, that thou hast brought
upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin?
thou hast done to us what thou oughtest not
to do.
10And again he expostulated with him, and
said: What sawest thou, that thou hast done
this?
11Abraham answered: I thought with myself,
saying: Perhaps there is not the fear of God in
this place: and they will kill me for the sake of
my wife:
12Howbeit, otherwise also she is truly my
sister, the daughter of my father, and not the
daughter of my mother, and I took her to wife.
13And after God brought me out of my fa-
ther's house, I said to her: Thou shalt do me
this kindness: In every place, to which we shall
come, thou shalt say that I am thy brother.
14And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and
servants and handmaids, and gave to Abraham:
and restored to him Sara his wife,
15And said: The land is before you, dwell
wheresoever it shall please thee.
16And to Sara he said: Behold I have given
thy brother a thousand pieces of silver, this shall
serve thee for a covering of thy eyes to all that
are with thee, and whithersoever thou shalt go:and remember thou wast taken.
17And when Abraham prayed, God healed
Abimelech and his wife, and his handmaids, and
they bore children:
18For the Lord had closed up every womb
of the house of Abimelech, on account of Sara,
Abraham's wife.
Chapter 21
And the Lord visited Sara, as he had promised:
and fullled what he had spoken.
2And she conceived and bore a son in her old
age, at the time that God had foretold her.
3And Abraham called the name of his son,
whom Sara bore him, Isaac.
4And he circumcised him the eighth day, as
God had commanded him,
5When he was a hundred years old: for at
this age of his father, was Isaac born.
6And Sara said: God hath made a laughter
for me: whosoever shall hear of it will laugh with
me.
7And again she said: Who would believe that
Abraham should hear that Sara gave suck to a
son, whom she bore to him in his old age?
8And the child grew, and was weaned: and
Abraham made a great feast on the day of his
weaning.
9And when Sara had seen the son of Agar,
the Egyptian, playing with Isaac, her son, she
said to Abraham:
10Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for
the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with
my son Isaac.
11Abraham took this grievously for his son.
12And God said to him: Let it not seem
grievous to thee for the boy, and for thy bond-
woman: in all that Sara hath said to thee, hear-
ken to her voice: for in Isaac shall thy seed be
called.
13But I will make the son also of the bond-
woman a great nation, because he is thy seed.
14So Abraham rose up in the morning, and
taking bread and a bottle of water, put it upon
her shoulder, and delivered the boy, and sent her
away. And she departed, and wandered in the
wilderness of Bersabee.
15And when the water in the bottle was
spent, she cast the boy under one of the trees
that were there.
16And she went her way, and sat overagainst
him a great way o, as far as a bow can carry, for
she said: I will not see the boy die: and sitting
overagainst, she lifted up her voice and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the boy: and
an angel of God called to Agar from heaven, say-
ing: What art thou doing, Agar? fear not; for
God hath heard the voice of the boy, from the
place wherein he is.
18Arise, take up the boy, and hold him by
the hand, for I will make him a great nation.
19And God opened her eyes: and she saw a
well of water, and went and lled the bottle, and
gave the boy to drink.
20And God was with him: and he grew, and
dwelt in the wilderness, and became a young
man, an archer.
21And he dwelt in the wilderness of Pharan,
and his mother took a wife for him out of the
land of Egypt.
22At the same time Abimelech, and Phicol
the general of his army, said to Abraham: God
is with thee in all that thou dost.
23Swear therefore by God, that thou wilt not
hurt me, nor my posterity, nor my stock: but ac-
cording to the kindness that I have done to thee,
thou shalt do to me, and to the land wherein
thou hast lived a stranger.24And Abraham said: I will swear.
25And he reproved Abimelech for a well of
water, which his servants had taken away by
force.
26And Abimelech answered: I knew not who
did this thing: and thou didst not tell me, and I
heard not of it till today.
27Then Abraham took sheep and oxen, and
gave them to Abimelech: and both of them made
a league.
28And Abraham set apart seven ewelambs of
the 
ock.
29And Abimelech said to him: What mean
these seven ewelambs which thou hast set apart?
30But he said: Thou shalt take seven ewe-
lambs at my hand: that they may be a testimony
for me, that I dug this well.
31Therefore that place was called Bersabee;
because there both of them did swear.
32And they made a league for the well of
oath.
33And Abimelech and Phicol, the general
of his army, arose and returned to the land of
the Palestines. But Abraham planted a grove in
Bersabee, and there called upon the name of the
Lord God eternal.
34And he was a sojourner in the land of the
Palestines many days.
Chapter 22
After these things, God tempted Abraham, and
said to him: Abraham, Abraham. And he an-
swered: Here I am.
2He said to him: Take thy only begotten son
Isaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land
of vision; and there thou shalt oer him for an
holocaust upon one of the mountains which I will
shew thee.
3So Abraham rising up in the night, saddled
his ass, and took with him two young men, and
Isaac his son: and when he had cut wood for the
holocaust, he went his way to the place which
God had commanded him.
4And on the third day, lifting up his eyes, he
saw the place afar o.
5And he said to his young men: Stay you here
with the ass; I and the boy will go with speed
as far as yonder, and after we have worshipped,
will return to you.
6And he took the wood for the holocaust, and
laid it upon Isaac his son; and he himself carried
in his hands re and a sword. And as they two
went on together,
7Isaac said to his father: My father. And he
answered: What wilt thou, son? Behold, saith
he, re and wood: where is the victim for the
holocaust?
8And Abraham said: God will provide him-
self a victim for an holocaust, my son. So they
went on together.
9And they came to the place which God had
shewn him, where he built an altar, and laid the
wood in order upon it; and when he had bound
Isaac his son, he laid him on the altar upon the
pile of wood.
10And he put forth his hand, and took the
sword, to sacrice his son.
11And behold, an angel of the Lord from
heaven called to him, saying: Abraham, Abra-
ham. And he answered: Here I am.
12And he said to him: Lay not thy hand upon
the boy, neither do thou any thing to him: now I
know that thou fearest God, and hast not spared
thy only begotten son for my sake.
13Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw behind
his back a ram, amongst the briers, sticking fast
by the horns, which he took and oered for a
holocaust instead of his son.14And he called the name of that place, The
Lord seeth. Whereupon, even to this day, it is
said: In the mountain the Lord will see.
15And the angel of the Lord called to Abra-
ham a second time from heaven, saying:
16By my own self have I sworn, saith the
Lord: because thou hast done this thing, and
hast not spared thy only begotten son for my
sake:
17I will bless thee, and I will multiply thy
seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that
is by the sea shore; thy seed shall possess the
gates of their enemies.
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the
earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed my
voice.
19Abraham returned to his young men, and
they went to Bersabee together, and he dwelt
there.
20After these things, it was told Abraham,
that Melcha also had borne children to Nachor
his brother.
21Hus, the rstborn, and Buz, his brother,
and Camuel the father of the Syrians,
22And Cased, and Azau, and Pheldas, and
Jedlaph,
23And Bathuel, of whom was born Rebecca:
these eight did Melcha bear to Nachor, Abra-
ham's brother.
24And his concubine, named Roma, bore
Tabee, and Gaham, and Tahas, and Maacha.
Chapter 23
And Sara lived a hundred and twenty-seven
years.
2And she died in the city of Arbee which is
Hebron, in the land of Chanaan: and Abraham
came to mourn and weep for her.
3And after he rose up from the funeral obse-
quies, he spoke to the children of Heth, saying:
4I am a stranger and sojourner among you:
give me the right of a burying place with you,
that I may bury my dead.
5The children of Heth answered, saying:
6My lord, hear us, thou art a prince of God
among us: bury thy dead in our principal sepul-
chres: and no man shall have power to hinder
thee from burying thy dead in his sepulchre.
7Abraham rose up, and bowed down to the
people of the land, to wit, the children of Heth:
8And said to them: If it please your soul that
I should bury my dead, hear me, and intercede
for me to Ephron the son of Seor.
9That he may give me the double cave, which
he hath in the end of his eld: For as much
money as it is worth he shall give it me before
you, for a possession of a burying place.
10Now Ephron dwelt in the midst of the
children of Heth. And Ephron made answer to
Abraham in the hearing of all that went in at
the gate of the city, saying:
11Let it not be so, my lord, but do thou
rather hearken to what I say: The eld I de-
liver to thee, and the cave that is therein; in the
presence of the children of my people, bury thy
dead.
12Abraham bowed down before the people of
the land.
13And he spoke to Ephron, in the presence
of the people: I beseech thee to hear me: I will
give money for the eld; take it, and so will I
bury my dead in it.
14And Ephron answered:
15My lord, hear me. The ground which thou
desirest, is worth four hundred sicles of silver:
this is the price between me and thee: but what
is this? bury thy dead.16And when Abraham had heard this, he
weighed out the money that Ephron had asked,
in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hun-
dred sicles of silver, of common current money.
17And the eld that before was Ephron's,
wherein was the double cave, looking towards
Mambre, both it and the cave, and all the trees
thereof, in all its limits round about,
18Was made sure to Abraham for a posses-
sion, in the sight of the children of Heth, and of
all that went in at the gate of his city.
19And so Abraham buried Sara, his wife, in
the double cave of the eld, that looked towards
Mambre, this is Hebron in the land of Chanaan.
20And the eld was made sure to Abraham,
and the cave that was in it, for a possession to
bury in, by the children of Heth.
Chapter 24
Now Abraham was old, and advanced in age; and
the Lord had blessed him in all things.
2And he said to the elder servant of his house,
who was ruler over all he had: Put thy hand
under my thigh,
3That I may make thee swear by the Lord, the
God of heaven and earth, that thou take not a
wife for my son, of the daughters of the Chanaan-
ites, among whom I dwell:
4But that thou go to my own country and
kindred, and take a wife from thence for my son
Isaac.
5The servant answered: If the woman will not
come with me into this land, must I bring thy son
back again to the place from whence thou camest
out?
6And Abraham said: Beware thou never
bring my son back again thither.
7The Lord God of heaven, who took me out
of my father's house, and out of my native coun-
try, who spoke to me, and swore to me, saying:
To thy seed will I give this land: he will send
his angel before thee, and thou shalt take from
thence a wife for my son.
8But if the woman will not follow thee, thou
shalt not be bound by the oath: only bring not
my son back thither again.
9The servant, therefore, put his hand under
the thigh of Abraham, his lord, and swore to him
upon his word.
10And he took ten camels of his master's
herd, and departed, carrying something of all his
goods with him, and he set forward and went on
to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nachor.
11And when he had made the camels lie down
without the town, near a well of water, in the
evening, at the time when women are wont to
come out to draw water, he said:
12O Lord, the God of my master, Abraham,
meet me today, I beseech thee, and shew kind-
ness to my master, Abraham.
13Behold, I stand nigh the spring of water,
and the daughters of the inhabitants of this city
will come out to draw water:
14Now, therefore, the maid to whom I shall
say: Let down thy pitcher that I may drink:
and she shall answer, Drink, and I will give thy
camels drink also: let it be the same whom thou
hast provided for thy servant Isaac: and by this,
I shall understand that thou hast shewn kindness
to my master.
15He had not yet ended these words within
himself, and behold Rebecca came out, the
daughter of Bathuel, son of Melcha, wife to Na-
chor the brother of Abraham, having a pitcher
on her shoulder:
16An exceeding comely maid, and a most
beautiful virgin, and not known to man: and she
went down to the spring, and lled her pitcher,and was coming back.
17And the servant ran to meet her, and said:
Give me a little water to drink of thy pitcher.
18And she answered: Drink, my lord. And
quickly she let down the pitcher upon her arm,
and gave him drink.
19And when he had drunk, she said: I will
draw water for thy camels also, till they all drink.
20And pouring out the pitcher into the
troughs, she ran back to the well to draw water;
and having drawn, she gave to all the camels.
21But he musing, beheld her with silence,
desirous to know whether the Lord had made
his journey prosperous or not.
22And after that the camels had drunk, the
man took out golden earrings, weighing two
sicles; and as many bracelets, of ten sicles weight.
23And he said to her: Whose daughter art
thou? tell me: is there any place in thy father's
house to lodge?
24And she answered: I am the daughter of
Bathuel, the son of Melcha, whom she bore to
Nachor.
25And she said, moreover, to him: We have
good store of both straw and hay, and a large
place to lodge in.
26The man bowed himself down, and adored
the Lord,
27Saying: Blessed be the Lord God of my
master Abraham, who hath not taken away his
mercy and truth from my master, and hath
brought me the straight way into the house of
my master's brother.
28Then the maid ran, and told in her
mother's house all that she had heard.
29And Rebecca had a brother, named Laban,
who went out in haste to the man, to the well.
30And when he had seen the earrings and
bracelets in his sister's hands, and had heard all
that she related, saying, Thus and thus the man
spoke to me: he came to the man who stood by
the camels, and near to the spring of water,
31And said to him: Come in, thou blessed
of the Lord; why standest thou without? I have
prepared the house, and a place for the camels.
32And he brought him into his lodging; and
he unharnessed the camels, and gave straw and
hay, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of
the men that were come with him.
33And bread was set before him. But he said:
I will not eat, till I tell my message. He answered
him: Speak.
34And he said: I am the servant of Abraham:
35And the Lord hath blessed my master won-
derfully, and he is become great: and he hath
given him sheep and oxen, silver and gold, men
servants and women servants, camels and asses.
36And Sara, my master's wife, hath borne my
master a son in her old age, and he hath given
him all that he had.
37And my master made me swear, saying:
Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the
Chanaanites, in whose land I dwell:
38But thou shalt go to my father's house, and
shalt take a wife of my own kindred for my son:
39But I answered my master: What if the
woman will not come with me?
40The Lord, said he, in whose sight I walk,
will send his angel with thee, and will direct thy
way: and thou shalt take a wife for my son of
my own kindred, and of my father's house.
41But thou shalt be clear from my curse,
when thou shalt come to my kindred, if they will
not give thee one.
42And I came today to the well of water,
and said: O Lord God of my master, Abraham,
if thou hast prospered my way, wherein I now
walk,
43Behold, I stand by the well of water, and
the virgin, that shall come out to draw water,who shall hear me say: Give me a little water to
drink of thy pitcher:
44And shall say to me: Both drink thou, and
I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be
the woman, whom the Lord hath prepared for
my master's son.
45And whilst I pondered these things secretly
with myself, Rebecca appeared, coming with a
pitcher, which she carried on her shoulder: and
she went down to the well and drew water. And
I said to her: Give me a little to drink.
46And she speedily let down the pitcher from
her shoulder, and said to me: Both drink thou,
and to thy camels I will give drink. I drank, and
she watered the camels.
47And I asked her, and said: Whose daughter
art thou? And she answered: I am the daugh-
ter of Bathuel, the son of Nachor, whom Melcha
bore to him. So I put earrings on her to adorn
her face, and I put bracelets on her hands.
48And falling down, I adored the Lord, bless-
ing the Lord God of my master, Abraham, who
hath brought me the straight way to take the
daughter of my master's brother for his son.
49Wherefore, if you do according to mercy
and truth with my master, tell me: but if it
please you otherwise, tell me that also, that I
may go to the right hand, or to the left.
50And Laban and Bathuel answered: The
word hath proceeded from the Lord: we cannot
speak any other thing to thee but his pleasure.
51Behold, Rebecca is before thee, take her
and go thy way, and let her be the wife of thy
master's son, as the Lord hath spoken.
52Which when Abraham's servant heard,
falling down to the ground, he adored the Lord.
53And bringing forth vessels of silver and
gold, and garments, he gave them to Rebecca,
for a present. He oered gifts also to her broth-
ers, and to her mother.
54And a banquet was made, and they ate
and drank together, and lodged there. And in
the morning, the servant arose, and said: Let
me depart, that I may go to my master.
55And her brother and mother answered: Let
the maid stay, at least, ten days with us, and
afterwards she shall depart.
56Stay me not, said he, because the Lord
hath prospered my way: send me away, that I
may go to my master.
57And they said: Let us call the maid, and
ask her will.
58And they called her, and when she was
come, they asked: Wilt thou go with this man?
She said: I will go.
59So they sent her away, and her nurse, and
Abraham's servant, and his company.
60Wishing prosperity to their sister, and say-
ing: Thou art our sister, mayst thou increase to
thousands of thousands; and may thy seed pos-
sess the gates of their enemies.
61So Rebecca and her maids, being set upon
camels, followed the man: who with speed re-
turned to his master.
62At the same time, Isaac was walking along
the way to the well which is called Of the living
and the seeing: for he dwelt in the south country:
63And he was gone forth to meditate in the
eld, the day being now well spent: and when
he had lifted up his eyes, he saw camels coming
afar o.
64Rebecca also, when she saw Isaac, lighted
o the camel,
65And said to the servant: Who is that man
who cometh towards us along the eld? And he
said to her: That man is my master. But she
quickly took her cloak, and covered herself.
66And the servant told Isaac all that he had
done.67Who brought her into the tent of Sara his
mother, and took her to wife: and he loved her
so much, that it moderated the sorrow which was
occasioned by his mother's death.
Chapter 25
And Abraham married another wife named Ce-
tura:
2Who bore him Zamram, and Jecsan, and
Madan, and Madian, and Jesboc, and Sue.
3Jecsan also begot Saba, and Dadan. The
children of Dadan were Assurim, and Latusim,
and Loomim.
4But of Madian was born Epha, and Opher,
and Henoch, and Abida, and Eldaa: all these
were the children of Cetura.
5And Abraham gave all his possessions to
Isaac:
6And to the children of the concubines he
gave gifts, and separated them from Isaac his
son, while he yet lived, to the east country.
7And the days of Abraham's life were a hun-
dred and seventy-ve years.
8And decaying he died in a good old age, and
having lived a long time, and being full of days:
and was gathered to his people.
9And Isaac and Ismael his sons buried him
in the double cave, which was situated in the
eld of Ephron the son of Seor the Hethite, over
against Mambre,
10Which he had bought of the children of
Heth: there was he buried, and Sara his wife.
11And after his death, God blessed Isaac his
son, who dwelt by the well named Of the living
and seeing.
12These are the generations of Ismael the son
of Abraham, whom Agar the Egyptian, Sara's
servant, bore unto him:
13And these are the names of his children
according to their calling and generations. The
rstborn of Ismael was Nabajoth, then Cedar,
and Adbeel, and Mabsam,
14And Masma, and Duma, and Massa,
15Hadar, and Thema, and Jethur, and
Naphis, and Cedma.
16These are the sons of Ismael: and these are
their names by their castles and towns, twelve
princes of their tribes.
17And the years of Ismael's life were a hun-
dred and thirty-seven, and decaying he died, and
was gathered unto his people.
18And he dwelt from Hevila as far as Sur,
which looketh towards Egypt, to them that go
towards the Assyrians. He died in the presence
of all his brethren.
19These also are the generations of Isaac the
son of Abraham: Abraham begot Isaac:
20Who when he was forty years old, took to
wife Rebecca the daughter of Bathuel the Syrian
of Mesopotamia, sister to Laban.
21And Isaac besought the Lord for his wife,
because she was barren: and he heard him, and
made Rebecca to conceive.
22But the children struggled in her womb,
and she said: If it were to be so with me, what
need was there to conceive? And she went to
consult the Lord.
23And he answering, said: Two nations are
in thy womb, and two peoples shall be divided
out of thy womb, and one people shall overcome
the other, and the elder shall serve the younger.
24And when her time was come to be deliv-
ered, behold twins were found in her womb.
25He that came forth rst was red, and hairy
like a skin: and his name was called Esau. Imme-
diately the other coming forth, held his brother's
foot in his hand: and therefore he was called Ja-
cob.26Isaac was threescore years old when the
children were born unto him.
27And when they were grown up, Esau be-
came a skilful hunter, and a husbandman: but
Jacob, a plain man, dwelt in tents.
28Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his
hunting: and Rebecca loved Jacob.
29And Jacob boiled pottage: to whom Esau,
coming faint out of the eld,
30Said: Give me of this red pottage, for I am
exceeding faint. For which reason his name was
called Edom.
31And Jacob said to him: Sell me thy rst
birthright.
32He answered: Lo I die, what will the rst
birthright avail me?
33Jacob said: Swear therefore to me. Esau
swore to him, and sold his rst birthright.
34And so taking bread and the pottage of
lentils, he ate, and drank, and went on his way;
making little account of having sold his rst
birthright.
Chapter 26
And when a famine came in the land, after that
barrenness which had happened in the days of
Abraham, Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the
Palestines, to Gerara.
2And the Lord appeared to him, and said:
Go not down into Egypt, but stay in the land
that I shall tell thee.
3And sojourn in it, and I will be with thee,
and will bless thee: for to thee and to thy seed
I will give all these countries, to full the oath
which I swore to Abraham thy father.
4And I will multiply thy seed like the stars of
heaven: and I will give to thy posterity all these
countries: and in thy seed shall all the nations
of the earth be blessed.
5Because Abraham obeyed my voice, and
kept my precepts and commandments, and ob-
served my ceremonies and laws.
6So Isaac abode in Gerara.
7And when he was asked by the men of that
place, concerning his wife, he answered: She is
my sister: for he was afraid to confess that she
was his wife, thinking lest perhaps they would
kill him because of her beauty.
8And when very many days were passed,
and he abode there, Abimelech, king of the
Palestines, looking out through a window, saw
him playing with Rebecca, his wife.
9And calling for him, he said: It is evident
she is thy wife: why didst thou feign her to be
thy sister? He answered: I feared lest I should
die for her sake.
10And Abimelech said: Why hast thou de-
ceived us? Some man of the people might have
lain with thy wife, and thou hadst brought upon
us a great sin. And he commanded all the peo-
ple, saying:
11He that shall touch this man's wife, shall
surely be put to death.
12And Isaac sowed in that land, and he found
that same year a hundredfold: and the Lord
blessed him.
13And the man was enriched, and he went
on prospering and increasing, till he became ex-
ceeding great.
14And he had possessions of sheep and of
herds, and a very great family. Wherefore the
Palestines envying him,
15Stopped up at that time all the wells, that
the servants of his father, Abraham, had digged,
lling them up with earth:
16Insomuch that Abimelech himself said to
Isaac: Depart from us, for thou art become much
mightier than we.17So he departed, and came to the torrent of
Gerara, to dwell there:
18And he digged again other wells, which the
servants of his father, Abraham, had digged, and
which, after his death, the Philistines had of old
stopped up: and he called them by the same
names, by which his father before had called
them.
19And they digged in the torrent, and found
living water:
20But there also the herdsmen of Gerara
strove against the herdsmen of Isaac, saying: It is
our water. Wherefore he called the name of the
well, on occasion of that which had happened,
Calumny.
21And they digged also another; and for that
they quarrelled likewise, and he called the name
of it, Enmity.
22Going forward from thence, he digged an-
other well, for which they contended not; there-
fore he called the name thereof, Latitude, saying:
Now hath the Lord given us room, and made us
to increase upon the earth.
23And he went up from that place to
Bersabee,
24Where the Lord appeared to him that same
night, saying: I am the God of Abraham thy
father, do not fear, for I am with thee: I will
bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant
Abraham's sake.
25And he built there an altar: and called
upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent;
and commanded his servants to dig a well.
26To which place when Abimelech, and
Ochozath his friend, and Phicol chief captain of
his soldiers, came from Gerara,
27Isaac said to them: Why are ye come to
me, a man whom you hate, and have thrust out
from you?
28And they answered: We saw that the Lord
is with thee, and therefore we said: Let there be
an oath between us, and let us make a covenant,
29That thou do us no harm, as we on our part
have touched nothing of thine, nor have done any
thing to hurt thee; but with peace have sent thee
away, increased with the blessing of the Lord.
30And he made them a feast, and after they
had eaten and drunk:
31Arising in the morning, they swore one to
another: and Isaac sent them away peaceably to
their own home.
32And behold, the same day the servants of
Isaac came, telling him of a well which they had
digged, and saying: We have found water.
33Whereupon he called it Abundance: and
the name of the city was called Bersabee, even
to this day.
34And Esau being forty years old, married
wives, Judith, the daughter of Beeri, the Hethite,
and Basemath, the daughter of Elon, of the same
place.
35And they both oended the mind of Isaac
and Rebecca.
Chapter 27
Now Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, and
he could not see: and he called Esau, his elder
son, and said to him: My son? And he answered:
Here I am.
2And his father said to him, Thou seest that
I am old, and know not the day of my death.
3Take thy arms, thy quiver, and bow, and go
abroad; and when thou hast taken something by
hunting,
4Make me a savoury meat thereof, as thou
knowest I like, and bring it that I may eat: and
my soul may bless thee, before I die.
5And when Rebecca had heard this, and hewas gone into the eld to full his father's com-
mandment,
6She said to her son Jacob: I heard thy father
talking with Esau, thy brother, and saying to
him:
7Bring me of thy hunting, and make me meats
that I may eat, and bless thee in the sight of the
Lord, before I die.
8Now therefore, my son, follow my counsel:
9And go thy way to the 
ock, bring me two
kids of the best, that I may make of them meat
for thy father, such as he gladly eateth.
10Which when thou hast brought in, and he
hath eaten, he may bless thee before he die.
11And he answered her: Thou knowest that
Esau, my brother, is a hairy man, and I am
smooth:
12If my father should feel me, and perceive
it, I fear lest he will think I would have mocked
him, and I shall bring upon me a curse instead
of a blessing.
13And his mother said to him: Upon me be
this curse, my son: only hear thou my voice, and
go, fetch me the things which I have said.
14He went, and brought, and gave them to
his mother. She dressed meats, such as she knew
his father liked.
15And she put on him very good garments of
Esau, which she had at home with her:
16And the little skins of the kids she put
about his hands, and covered the bare of his
neck.
17And she gave him the savoury meat, and
delivered him bread that she had baked.
18Which when he had carried in, he said: My
father? But he answered: I hear. Who art thou,
my son?
19And Jacob said: I am Esau, thy rstborn:
I have done as thou didst command me: arise, sit
and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless
me.
20And Isaac said to his son: How couldst
thou nd it so quickly, my son? He answered:
It was the will of God, that what I sought came
quickly in my way:
21And Isaac said: Come hither, that I may
feel thee, my son, and may prove whether thou
be my son Esau, or no.
22He came near to his father, and when he
had felt him, Isaac said: The voice indeed is the
voice of Jacob; but the hands, are the hands of
Esau.
23And he knew him not, because his hairy
hands made him like to the elder. Then blessing
him,
24He said: Art thou my son Esau? He an-
swered: I am.
25Then he said: Bring me the meats of thy
hunting, my son, that my soul may bless thee.
And when they were brought, and he had eaten,
he oered him wine also, which after he had
drunk,
26He said to him: Come near me, and give
me a kiss, my son.
27He came near, and kissed him. And im-
mediately as he smelled the fragrant smell of
his garments, blessing him, he said: Behold, the
smell of my son is as the smell of a plentiful eld,
which the Lord hath blessed.
28God give thee of the dew of heaven, and of
the fatness of the earth, abundance of corn and
wine.
29And let peoples serve thee, and tribes wor-
ship thee: be thou lord of thy brethren, and
let thy mother's children bow down before thee.
Cursed be he that curseth thee: and let him that
blesseth thee be lled with blessings.
30Isaac had scarce ended his words, when,
Jacob being now gone out abroad, Esau came,31And brought in to his father meats, made
of what he had taken in hunting, saying: Arise,
my father, and eat of thy son's venison; that thy
soul may bless me.
32And Isaac said to him: Why! who art
thou? He answered: I am thy rstborn son,
Esau.
33Isaac was struck with fear, and astonished
exceedingly; and wondering beyond what can be
believed, said: Who is he then that even now
brought me venison that he had taken, and I ate
of all before thou camest? and I have blessed
him, and he shall be blessed.
34Esau having heard his father's words,
roared out with a great cry; and, being in a con-
sternation, said: Bless me also, my father.
35And he said: Thy brother came deceitfully
and got thy blessing.
36But he said again: Rightly is his name
called Jacob; for he hath supplanted me lo this
second time: My birthright he took away before,
and now this second time he hath stolen away
my blessing. And again he said to his father:
Hast thou not reserved me also a blessing?
37Isaac answered: I have appointed him thy
lord, and have made all his brethren his servants:
I have established him with corn and wine, and
after this, what shall I do more for thee, my son?
38And Esau said to him: Hast thou only one
blessing, father? I beseech thee bless me also.
And when he wept with a loud cry,
39Isaac being moved, said to him: In the
fat of the earth, and in the dew of heaven from
above,
40Shall thy blessing be. Thou shalt live by
the sword, and shalt serve thy brother: and the
time shall come, when thou shalt shake o and
loose his yoke from thy neck.
41Esau therefore always hated Jacob, for the
blessing wherewith his father had blessed him;
and he said in his heart: The days will come of
the mourning for my father, and I will kill my
brother Jacob.
42These things were told to Rebecca: and
she sent and called Jacob, her son, and said to
him: Behold Esau, thy brother, threateneth to
kill thee.
43Now therefore, my son, hear my voice, arise
and 
ee to Laban, my brother, to Haran:
44And thou shalt dwell with him a few days,
till the wrath of thy brother be assuaged,
45And his indignation cease, and he forget
the things thou hast done to him: afterwards
I will send, and bring thee from thence hither.
Why shall I be deprived of both my sons in one
day?
46And Rebecca said to Isaac: I am weary
of my life, because of the daughters of Heth: if
Jacob take a wife of the stock of this land, I
choose not to live.
Chapter 28
And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and
charged him, saying: Take not a wife of the stock
of Chanaan:
2But go, and take a journey to Mesopotamia
of Syria, to the house of Bathuel, thy mother's
father, and take thee a wife thence of the daugh-
ters of Laban, thy uncle.
3And God almighty bless thee, and make thee
to increase and multiply thee: that thou mayst
be a multitude of people.
4And give the blessings of Araham to thee,
and to thy seed after thee: that thou mayst
possess the land of thy sojournment, which he
promised to thy grandfather.
5And when Isaac had sent him away, he took
his journey and went to Mesopotamia of Syria,to Laban, the son of Bathuel, the Syrian, brother
to Rebecca, his mother.
6And Esau seeing that his father had blessed
Jacob, and had sent him into Mesopotamia of
Syria, to marry a wife thence; and that after the
blessing he had charged him, saying: Thou shalt
not take a wife of the daughters of Chanaan:
7And that Jacob obeying his parents, was
gone into Syria:
8Experiencing also, that his father was not
well pleased with the daughters of Chanaan:
9He went to Ismael, and took to wife, besides
them he had before, Maheleth, the daughter of
Ismael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nabajoth.
10But Jacob being departed from Bersabee,
went on to Haran.
11And when he was come to a certain place,
and would rest in it after sunset, he took of
the stones that lay there, and putting under his
head, slept in the same place.
12And he saw in his sleep a ladder stand-
ing upon the earth, and the top thereof touching
heaven: the angels also of God ascending and
descending by it.
13And the Lord leaning upon the ladder say-
ing to him: I am the Lord God of Abraham thy
father, and the God of Isaac: The land, wherein
thou sleepest, I will give to thee and to thy seed.
14And thy seed shall be as the dust of the
earth: thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and
to the east, and to the north, and to the south:
and IN THEE and thy seed, all the tribes of the
earth SHALL BE BLESSED.
15And I will be thy keeper whithersoever
thou goest, and will bring thee back into this
land: neither will I leave thee, till I shall have
accomplished all that I have said.
16And when Jacob awaked out of sleep, he
said: Indeed the Lord is in this place, and I knew
it not.
17And trembling, he said: How terrible is this
place? this is no other but the house of God, and
the gate of heaven.
18And Jacob arising in the morning, took the
stone which he had laid under his head, and set
it up for a title, pouring oil upon the top of it.
19And he called the name of the city Bethel,
which before was called Luza.
20And he made a vow, saying: If God shall
be with me, and shall keep me in the way, by
which I walk, and shall give me bread to eat,
and raiment to put on,
21And I shall return prosperously to my fa-
ther's house: the Lord shall be my God:
22And this stone, which I have set up for a
title, shall be called the house of God: and of
all things that thou shalt give to me, I will oer
tithes to thee.
Chapter 29
Then Jacob went on in his journey, and came
into the east country.
2And he saw a well in the eld, and three

ocks of sheep lying by it: for the beasts were
watered out of it, and the mouth thereof was
closed with a great stone.
3And the custom was, when all the sheep
were gathered together, to roll away the stone,
and after the sheep were watered, to put it on
the mouth of the well again.
4And he said to the shepherds: Brethren,
whence are you? They answered: Of Haran.
5And he asked them, saying: Know you La-
ban, the son of Nachor? They said: We know
him.
6He said: Is he in health? He is in health, say
they: and behold, Rachel, his daughter, cometh
with his 
ock.7And Jacob said: There is yet much day re-
maining, neither is it time to bring the 
ocks into
the folds again: rst give the sheep drink, and
so lead them back to feed.
8They answered: We cannot, till all the cattle
be gathered together, and we remove the stone
from the well's mouth, that we may water the

ocks.
9They were yet speaking, and behold Rachel
came with her father's sheep; for she fed the

ock.
10And when Jacob saw her, and knew her
to be his cousin german, and that they were the
sheep of Laban, his uncle: he removed the stone
wherewith the well was closed.
11And having watered the 
ock, he kissed
her: and lifting up his voice wept.
12And he told her that he was her father's
brother, and the son of Rebecca: but she went
in haste and told her father.
13Who, when he heard that Jacob his sister's
son was come, ran forth to meet him: and em-
bracing him, and heartily kissing him, brought
him into his house. And when he had heard the
causes of his journey,
14He answered: Thou art my bone and my

esh. And after the days of one month were
expired,
15He said to him: Because thou art my
brother, shalt thou serve me without wages? Tell
me what wages thou wilt have.
16Now he had two daughters, the name of
the elder was Lia; and the younger was called
Rachel.
17But Lia was blear eyed: Rachel was well
favoured, and of a beautiful countenance.
18And Jacob being in love with her, said:
I will serve thee seven years for Rachel, thy
younger daughter.
19Laban answered: It is better that I give her
to thee than to another man; stay with me.
20So Jacob served seven years for Rachel:
and they seemed but a few days, because of the
greatness of his love.
21And he said to Laban: Give me my wife;
for now the time is fullled, that I may go in
unto her.
22And he, having invited a great number of
his friends to the feast, made the marriage.
23And at night he brought in Lia, his daugh-
ter, to him,
24Giving his daughter a handmaid, named
Zelpha. Now when Jacob had gone in to her
according to custom, when morning was come
he saw it was Lia.
25And he said to his father in law: What is
it that thou didst mean to do? did not I serve
thee for Rachel? why hast thou deceived me?
26Laban answered: It is not the custom in
this place, to give the younger in marriage rst.
27Make up the week of days of this match:
and I will give thee her also, for the service that
thou shalt render me other seven years.
28He yielded to his pleasure: and after the
week was past, he married Rachel:
29To whom her father gave Bala, for her ser-
vant.
30And having at length obtained the mar-
riage he wished for, he preferred the love of the
latter before the former, and served with him
other seven years.
31And the Lord seeing that he despised Lia,
opened her womb, but her sister remained bar-
ren.
32And she conceived and bore a son, and
called his name Ruben, saying: The Lord saw
my aiction: now my husband will love me.
33And again she conceived and bore a son,
and said: Because the Lord heard that I wasdespised, he hath given this also to me: and she
called his name Simeon.
34And she conceived the third time, and bore
another son, and said: Now also my husband will
be joined to me, because I have borne him three
sons: and therefore she called his name Levi.
35The fourth time she conceived and bore a
son, and said: Now will I praise the Lord: and for
this she called him Juda. And she left bearing.
Chapter 30
And Rachel seeing herself without children, en-
vied her sister, and said to her husband: Give
me children, otherwise I shall die.
2And Jacob being angry with her, answered:
Am I as God, who hath deprived thee of the fruit
of thy womb?
3But she said: I have here my servant Bala:
go in unto her, that she may bear upon my knees,
and I may have children by her.
4And she gave him Bala in marriage: who,
5When her husband had gone in unto her,
conceived and bore a son.
6And Rachel said: The Lord hath judged for
me, and hath heard my voice, giving me a son;
and therefore she called his name Dan.
7And again Bala conceived, and bore another,
8For whom Rachel said: God hath compared
me with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she
called him Nephthali.
9Lia perceiving that she had left of bearing,
gave Zelpha, her handmaid, to her husband.
10And when she had conceived, and brought
forth a son,
11She said: Happily. And therefore called his
name Gad.
12Zelpha also bore another.
13And Lia said: This is for my happiness: for
women will call me blessed. Therefore she called
him Aser.
14And Ruben going out in the time of the
wheat harvest into the eld, found mandrakes:
which he brought to his mother Lia. And Rachel
said: Give me part of thy son's mandrakes.
15She answered: Dost thou think it a small
matter, that thou hast taken my husband from
me, unless thou take also my son's mandrakes?
Rachel said: He shall sleep with thee this night,
for thy son's mandrakes.
16And when Jacob returned at even from the
eld, Lia went out to meet him, and said: Thou
shalt come in unto me, because I have hired thee
for my son's mandrakes. And he slept with her
that night.
17And God heard her prayers; and she con-
ceived: and bore a fth son:
18And said: God hath given me a reward,
because I gave my handmaid to my husband.
And she called his name Issachar.
19And Lia conceived again, and bore the
sixth son,
20And said: God hath endowed me with a
good dowry; this turn also my husband will be
with me, because I have borne him six sons: and
therefore she called his name Zabulon.
21After whom she bore a daughter, named
Dina.
22The Lord also remembering Rachel, heard
her, and opened her womb.
23And she conceived, and bore a son, saying:
God hath taken away my reproach.
24And she called his name Joseph: saying:
The Lord give me also another son.
25And when Joseph was born, Jacob said to
his father in law: Send me away, that I may
return into my country, and to my land.26Give me my wives, and my children, for
whom I have served thee, that I may depart:
thou knowest the service that I have rendered
thee.
27Laban said to him: Let me nd favour in
thy sight: I have learned, by experience, that
God hath blessed me for thy sake.
28Appoint thy wages which I shall give thee.
29But he answered: Thou knowest how I have
served thee, and how great thy possession hath
been in my hands.
30Thou hadst but little before I came to thee,
and now thou art become rich: and the Lord
hath blessed thee at my coming. It is reasonable,
therefore, that I should now provide also for my
own house.
31And Laban said: What shall I give thee?
But he said: I require nothing; but if thou wilt
do what I demand, I will feed and keep thy sheep
again.
32Go round through all thy 
ocks, and sepa-
rate all the sheep of divers colours, and speckled;
and all that is brown and spotted, and of divers
colours, as well among the sheep as among the
goats, shall be my wages.
33And my justice shall answer for me tomor-
row before thee, when the time of the bargain
shall come; and all that is not of divers colours,
and spotted, and brown, as well among the sheep
as among the goats, shall accurse me of theft.
34And Laban said: I like well what thou de-
mandest.
35And he separated the same day the she
goats, and the sheep, and the he goats, and the
rams of divers colours, and spotted; and all the

ock of one colour, that is, of white and black

eece, he deliverdd into the hands of his sons.
36And he set the space of three days journey
betwixt himself and his son in law, who fed the
rest of his 
ock.
37And Jacob took green rods of poplar, and
of almond, and of plane trees, and pilled them
in part: so when the bark was taken o, in the
parts that were pilled, there appeared whiteness:
but the parts that were whole, remained green:
and by this means the colour was divers.
38And he put them in the troughs, where
the water was poured out; that when the 
ocks
should come to drink, they might have the rods
before their eyes, and in the sight of them might
conceive.
39And it came to pass, that in the very
heat of coition, the sheep beheld the rods, and
brought forth spotted, and of divers colours, and
speckled.
40And Jacob separated the 
ock, and put the
rods in the troughs before the eyes of the rams;
and all the white and the black were Laban's,
and the rest were Jacob's, when the 
ocks were
separated one from the other.
41So when the ewes went rst to ram, Ja-
cob put the rods in the troughs of water before
the eyes of the rams, and of the ewes, that they
might conceive while they were looking upon
them.
42But when the later coming was, and the
last conceiving, he did not put them. And those
that were lateward, became Laban's; and they
of the rst time, Jacob's.
43And the man was enriched exceedingly, and
he had many 
ocks, maidservants and menser-
vants, camels and asses.
Chapter 31
But after that he had heard the words of the
sons of Laban, saying: Jacob hath taken away
all that was our father's, and being enriched by
his substance is become great.2And perceiving also, that Laban's counte-
nance was not towards him as yesterday and the
other day.
3Especially the Lord saying to him: Return
into the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred,
and I will be with thee.
4He sent, and called Rachel and Lia into the
eld, where he fed the 
ocks,
5And said to them: I see your father's coun-
tenance is not towards me as yesterday and the
other day: but the God of my father hath been
with me.
6And you know that I have served your father
to the uttermost of my power.
7Yea your father hath also overreached me,
and hath changed my wages ten times: and yet
God hath not suered him to hurt me.
8If at any time, he said: The speckled shall be
thy wages: all the sheep brought forth speckled:
but when he said on the contrary: Thou shalt
take all the white one for thy wages: all the 
ocks
brought forth white ones.
9And God hath taken your father's sub-
stance, and given it to me.
10For after the time came of the ewes conceiv-
ing, I lifted up my eyes, and saw in my sleep, that
the males which leaped upon the females were of
divers colours, and spotted, and speckled.
11And the angel of God said to me in my
sleep: Jacob. And I answered: Here I am.
12And he said: Lift up thy eyes, and see that
all the males leaping upon the females, are of
divers colours, spotted and speckled. For I have
seen all that Laban hath done to thee.
13I am the God of Bethel, where thou didst
anoint the stone, and make a vow to me. Now
therefore arise, and go out of this land, and re-
turn into thy native country.
14And Rachel and Lia answered: Have we
any thing left among the goods and inheritance
of our father's house?
15Hath he not counted us as strangers, and
sold us, and eaten up the price of us?
16But God hath taken our father's riches, and
delivered them to us, and to our children: where-
fore, do all that God hath commanded thee.
17Then Jacob rose up, and having set his
children and wives upon camels, went his way.
18And he took all his substance, and 
ocks,
and whatsoever he had gotten in Mesopotamia,
and went forward to Isaac, his father, to the land
of Chanaan.
19At that time Laban was gone to shear his
sheep, and Rachel stole away her father's idols.
20And Jacob would not confess to his father
in law that he was 
ying away.
21And when he was gone, together with all
that belonged to him, and having passed the
river, was going on towards mount Galaad,
22It was told Laban on the third day, that
Jacob 
ed.
23And he took his brethren with him, and
pursued after him seven days; and overtook him
in the mount of Galaad.
24And he saw in a dream God, saying to
him: Take heed thou speak not any thing harshly
against Jacob.
25Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the
mountain: and when he, with his brethren, had
overtaken him, he pitched his tent in the same
mount of Galaad.
26And he said to Jacob: Why hast thou done
thus, to carry away, without my knowledge, my
daughters as captives taken with the sword?
27Why wouldst thou run away privately, and
not acquaint me, that I might have brought thee
on the way with joy, and with songs, and with
timbrels, and with harps?
28Thou hast not suered me to kiss my sons
and daughters; thou hast done foolishly; and nowindeed,
29It is in my power to return thee evil; but the
God of your father said to me yesterday: Take
heed thou speak not any thing harshly against
Jacob.
30Suppose thou didst desire to go to thy
friends, and hadst a longing after thy father's
house: why hast thou stolen away my gods?
31Jacob answered: That I departed unknown
to thee, it was for fear lest thou wouldst take
away thy daughters by force.
32But, whereas, thou chargest me with theft:
with whomsoever thou shalt nd thy gods, let
him be slain before our brethren. Search, and if
thou nd any of thy things with me, take them
away. Now when he said this, he knew not that
Rachel had stolen the idols.
33So Laban went into the tent of Jacob,
and of Lia, and of both the handmaids, and
found them not. And when he was entered into
Rachel's tent,
34She, in haste, hid the idols under the
camel's furniture, and sat upon them: and when
he had searched all the tent, and found nothing,
35She said: Let not my lord be angry that
I cannot rise up before thee, because it has
now happened to me according to the custom
of women. So his careful search was in vain.
36And Jacob being angry, said in a chiding
manner: For what fault of mine, and for what
oence on my part hast thou so hotly pursued
me,
37And searched all my household stu?
What hast thou found of all the substance of thy
house? lay it here before my brethren, and thy
brethren, and let them judge between me and
thee.
38Have I, therefore, been with thee twenty
years? thy ewes and goats were not barren, the
rams of thy 
ocks I did not eat:
39Neither did I shew thee that which the
beast had torn; I made good all the damage:
whatsoever was lost by theft, thou didst exact it
of me:
40Day and night was I parched with heat, and
with frost, and sleep departed from my eyes.
41And in this manner have I served thee in
thy house twenty years, fourteen for thy daugh-
ters, and six for thy 
ocks: thou hast changed
also my wages ten times.
42Unless the God of my father, Abraham,
and the fear of Isaac, had stood by me, peradven-
ture now thou hadst sent me away naked: God
beheld my aiction and the labour of my hands,
and rebuked thee yesterday.
43Laban answered him: The daughters are
mine, and the children, and thy 
ocks, and all
things that thou seest are mine: what can I do
to my children, and grandchildren?
44Come, therefore, let us enter into a league;
that it may be for a testimony between me and
thee.
45And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for
a title.
46And he said to his brethren: Bring hither
stones. And they, gathering stones together,
made a heap, and they ate upon it.
47And Laban called it, The witness heap; and
Jacob, The hillock of testimony: each of them
according to the propriety of his language.
48And Laban said: This heap shall be a wit-
ness between me and thee this day, and therefore
the name thereof was called Galaad, that is, The
witness heap.
49The Lord behold and judge between us,
when we shall be gone one from the other.
50If thou aict my daughters, and if thou
bring in other wives over them: none is witness
of our speech but God, who is present and be-
holdeth.51And he said again to Jacob: Behold this
heap, and the stone which I have set up between
me and thee,
52Shall be a witness: this heap, I say, and
the stone, be they for a testimony, if either I
shall pass beyond it going towards thee, or thou
shalt pass beyond it thinking harm to me.
53The God of Abraham, and the God of Na-
chor, the God of their father, judge betweeen us.
And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac:
54And after he had oered sacrices in the
mountain, he called his brethren to eat bread.
And when they had eaten, they lodged there:
55But Laban arose in the night, and kissed
his sons and daughters, and blessed them: and
returned to his place.
Chapter 32
Jacob also went on the journey he had begun:
and the angels of God met him.
2And when he saw them, he said: These are
the camps of God, and he called the name of
that place Mahanaim, that is, Camps.
3And he sent messengers before him to Esau,
his brother, to the land of Seir, to the country of
Edom:
4And he commanded them, saying: Thus
shall ye speak to my lord Esau: Thus saith thy
brother Jacob: I have sojourned with Laban, and
have been with him until this day:
5I have oxen, and asses, and sheep, and
menservants, and womenservants: and now I
send a message to my lord, that I may nd favour
in thy sight.
6And the messengers returned to Jacob, say-
ing: We came to Esau, thy brother, and behold
he cometh with speed to meet thee with four
hundred men.
7Then Jacob was greatly afraid; and in his
fear divided the people that was with him, and
the 
ocks, and the sheep, and the oxen, and the
camels, into two companies,
8Saying: If Esau come to one company, and
destroy it, the other company that is left, shall
escape.
9And Jacob said: O God of my fahter Abra-
ham, and God of my father Isaac: O Lord who
saidst to me, Return to thy land, and to the place
of thy birth, and I will do well for thee.
10I am not worthy of the least of all thy mer-
cies, and of thy truth which thou hast fullled
to thy servant. With my sta I passed over this
Jordan; and now I return with two companies.
11Deliver me from the hand of my brother
Esau, for I am greatly afraid of him; lest perhaps
he come, and kill the mother with the children.
12Thou didst say, that thou wouldst do well
by me, and multiply my seed like the sand of the
sea, which connot be numbered for multitude.
13And when he had slept there that night, he
set apart, of the things which he had, presents
for his brother Esau,
14Two hundred she goats, twenty he goats,
two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,
15Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty
kine, and twenty bulls, twenty she asses, and ten
of their foals.
16And he sent them by the hands of his ser-
vants, every drove by itself, and he said to his
servants: Go before me, and let there be a space
between drove and drove.
17And he commanded the rst, saying: If
thou meet my brother Esau, and he ask thee:
Whose art thou? or whither goest thou? or
whose are these before thee?
18Thou shalt answer: Thy servant Jacob's:
he hath sent them as a present to my lord Esau;
and he cometh after us.19In like manner he commanded the second,
and the third, and all that followed the droves,
saying: Speak ye the same words to Esau, when
ye nd him.
20And ye shall add: Thy servant Jacob him-
self also followeth after us; for he said: I will
appease him with the presents that go before,
and afterwards I will see him, perhaps he will be
gracious to me.
21So the presents went before him, but him-
self lodged that night in the camp.
22And rising early, he took his two wives and
his two handmaids, with his eleven sons, and
passed over the ford of Jaboc.
23And when all things were brought over that
belonged to him,
24He remained alone; and behold, a man
wrestled with him till morning.
25And when he saw that he could not over-
come him, he touched the sinew of his thigh, and
forthwith it shrank.
26And he said to him: Let me go, for it is
break of day. He answered: I will not let thee
go, except thou bless me.
27And he said: What is thy name? He an-
swered: Jacob.
28But he said: Thy name shall not be called
Jacob, but Israel; for if thou hast been strong
against God, how much more shalt thou prevail
against men?
29Jacob asked him: Tell me by what name
art thou called? He answered: Why dost thou
ask my name? And he blessed him in the same
place.
30And Jacob called the name of the place
Phanuel, saying: I have seen God face to face,
and my soul has been saved.
31And immediately the sun rose upon him,
after he was past Phanuel; but he halted on his
foot.
32Therefore the children of Israel, unto this
day, eat not the sinew, that shrank in Jacob's
thigh: because he touched the sinew of his thigh
and it shrank.
Chapter 33
And Jacob lifting up his eyes, saw Esau coming,
and with him four hundred men: and he divided
the children of Lia and of Rachel, and of the two
handmaids.
2And he put both the handmaids and their
children foremost: and Lia and her children in
the second place: and Rachel and Joseph last.
3And he went forward and bowed down with
his face to the ground seven times, until his
brother came near.
4Then Esau ran to meet his brother, and em-
braced him: and clasping him fast about the
neck, and kissing him, wept.
5And lifting up his eyes, he saw the women
and their children, and said: What mean these?
And do they belong to thee? He answered: They
are the children which God hath given to me, thy
servant.
6Then the handmaids and their children came
near and bowed themselves.
7Lia also, with her children, came near and
bowed down in like manner; and last of all,
Joseph and Rachel bowed down.
8And Esau said: What are the droves that
I met? He answered: That I might nd favour
before my lord.
9But he said: I have plenty, my brother, keep
what is thine for thyself.
10And Jacob said: Do not so I beseech thee,
but if I have found favour in thy eyes, receive a
little present at my hands: for I have seen thy
face, as if I should have seen the countenance ofGod: be gracious to me,
11And take the blessing which I have brought
thee, and which God hath given me, who giveth
all things. He took it with much ado at his
brother's earnest pressing him,
12And said: Let us go on together, and I will
accompany thee in thy journey.
13And Jacob said: My lord, thou knowest
that I have with me tender children, and sheep,
and kine with young: which if I should cause to
be overdriven, in one day all the 
ocks will die.
14May it please my lord to go before his ser-
vant: and I will follow softly after him, as I shall
see my children to be able, until I come to my
lord in Seir.
15Esau answered: I beseech thee, that some
of the people, at least, who are with me, may
stay to accompany thee in the way. And he said:
There is no necessity: I want nothing else but
only to nd favour, my lord, in thy sight.
16So Esau returned that day, the way that
he came, to Seir.
17And Jacob came to Socoth: where having
built a house, and pitched tents, he called the
name of the place Socoth, that is, Tents.
18And he passed over to Salem, a city of the
Sichemites, which is in the land of Chanaan, af-
ter he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria: and
he dwelt by the town.
19And he bought that part of the eld, in
which he pitched his tents, of the children of
Hemor, the father of Sichem, for a hundred
lambs.
20And raising an altar there, he invoked upon
it the most mighty God of Israel.
Chapter 34
And Dina the daughter of Lia went out to see
the women of that country.
2And when Sichem the son of Hemor the
Hevite, the prince of that land, saw her, he was
in love with her: and took her away, and lay with
her, ravishing the virgin.
3And his soul was fast knit unto her; and
whereas she was sad, he comforted her with
sweet words.
4And going to Hemor his father, he said: Get
me this damsel to wife.
5But when Jacob had heard this, his sons
being absent, and employed in feeding the cattle,
he held his peace till they came back.
6And when Hemor the father of Sichem was
come out to speak to Jacob,
7Behold his sons came from the eld: and
hearing what had passed, they were exceeding
angry, because he had done a foul thing in Israel,
and committed an unlawful act, in ravishing Ja-
cob's daughter.
8And Hemor spoke to them: The soul of my
son Sichem has a longing for your daughter: give
her him to wife:
9And let us contract marriages one with an-
other: give us your daughters, and take you our
daughters.
10And dwell with us: the land is at your
command, till, trade, and possess it.
11Sichem also said to her father and to her
brethren: Let me nd favour in your sight, and
whatsoever you shall appoint I will give:
12Raise the dowry, and ask gifts, and I will
gladly give what you shall demand: only give me
this damsel to wife.
13The sons of Jacob answered Sichem and his
father deceitfully, being enraged at the de
ower-
ing of their sister:14We cannot do what you demand, nor give
our sister to one that is uncircumcised; which
with us is unlawful and abominable.
15But in this we may be allied with you, if
you will be like us, and all the male sex among
you be circumcised:
16Then will we mutually give and take your
daughters, and ours; and we will dwell with you,
and will be one people:
17But if you will not be circumcised, we will
take our daughter and depart.
18Their oer pleased Hemor, and Sichem, his
son:
19And the young man made no delay, but
forthwith fullled what was required: for he
loved the damsel exceedingly, and he was the
greatest man in all his father's house.
20And going into the gate of the city, they
spoke to the people:
21These men are peaceable, and are willing
to dwell with us: let them trade in the land, and
till it, which being large and wide wanteth men
to till it: we shall take their daughters for wives,
and we will give them ours.
22One thing there is for which so great a
good is deferred: We must circumcise every male
among us, following the manner of the nation.
23And their substance, and cattle, and all
that they possess, shall be ours; only in this let us
condescend, and by dwelling together, we shall
make one people.
24And they all agreed, and circumcised all
the males.
25And behold the third day, when the pain
of the wound was greatest: two of the sons of
Jacob, Simeon and Levi, the brothers of Dina,
taking their swords, entered boldly into the city
and slew all the men.
26And they killed also Hemor and Sichem,
and took away their sister Dina out of Sichem's
house.
27And when they were gone out, the other
sons of Jacob came upon the slain; and plun-
dered the city in revenge of the rape.
28And they took their sheep, and their herds,
and their asses, wasting all they had in their
houses and in their elds.
29And their children and wives they took
captive.
30And when they had boldly perpetrated
these things, Jacob said to Simeon and Levi: You
have troubled me, and made me hateful to the
Chanaanites and Pherezites, the inhabitants of
this land. We are few: they will gather them-
selves together and kill me; and both I, and my
house shall be destroyed.
31They answered: Should they abuse our sis-
ter as a strumpet?
Chapter 35
In the mean time God said to Jacob: Arise and
go up to Bethel, and dwell there, and make there
an altar to God, who appeared to thee when thou
didst 
ee from Esau, thy brother.
2And Jacob having called together all his
household, said: Cast away the strange gods that
are among you, and be cleansed, and change your
garments.
3Arise, and let us go up to Bethel, that we
may make there an altar to God; who heard me
in the day of my aiction, and accompained me
in my journey.
4So they gave him all the strange gods they
had, and the earrings which were in their ears:
and he buried them under the turpentine tree,
that is behind the city of Sichem.
5And when they were departed, the terror
of God fell upon all the cities round about, andthey durst not pursue after them as they went
away.
6And Jacob came to Luza, which is in the
land of Chanaan, surnamed Bethel: he and all
the people that were with him.
7And he built there an altar, and called the
name of that place, The house of God: for there
God appeared to him when he 
ed from his
brother.
8At the same time Debora, the nurse of Re-
becca, died, and was buried at the foot of Bethel,
under an oak, and the name of that place was
called, The oak of weeping.
9And God appeared again to Jacob, after
he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria, and he
blessed him,
10Saying: Thou shalt not be called any more
Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name. And he
called him Israel.
11And said to him: I am God almighty, in-
crease thou and be multiplied. Nations and peo-
ples of nations shall be from thee, and kings shall
come out of thy loins.
12And the land which I gave to Abraham and
Isaac, I will give to thee, and to thy seed after
thee.
13And he departed from him.
14But he set up a monument of stone, in the
place where God had spoken to him: pouring
drink erings upon it, and pouring oil thereon:
15And calling the name of that place Bethel.
16And going forth from thence, he came in
the spring time to the land which leadeth to
Ephrata: wherein when Rachel was in travail,
17By reason of her hard labour, she began to
be in danger, and the midwife said to her: Fear
not, for thou shalt have this son also.
18And when her soul was departing for pain,
and death was now at hand, she called the name
of her son Benoni, that is, the son of my pain:
but his father called him Benjamin, that is, the
son of the right hand.
19So Rachel died, and was buried in the high-
way that leadeth to Ephrata, this is Bethlehem.
20And Jacob erected a pillar over her sepul-
chre: this is the pillar of Rachel's monument, to
this day.
21Departing thence, he pitched his tent be-
yond the Flock tower.
22And when he dwelt in that country, Ruben
went, and slept with Bala the concubine of his
father: which he was not ignorant of. Now the
sons of Jacob were twelve.
23The sons of Lia: Ruben the rst born, and
Simeon, and Levi, and Juda, and Issachar, and
Zabulon.
24The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
25The sons of Bala, Rachel's handmaid: Dan
and Nephthali.
26The sons of Zelpha, Lia's handmaid: Gad
and Aser: these are the sons of Jacob, that were
born to him in Mesopotamia of Syria.
27And he came to Isaac his father in Mam-
bre, the city of Arbee, this is Hebron: wherein
Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
28And the days of Isaac were a hundred and
eighty years.
29And being spent with age he died, and was
gathered to his people, being old and full of days:
and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
Chapter 36
And these are the generations of Esau, the same
is Edom.
2Esau took wives of the daughters of
Chanaan: Ada the daughter of Elon the Hethite,
and Oolibama the daughter of Ana, the daughter
of Sebeon the Hevite:3And Basemath, the daughter of Ismael, sis-
ter of Nabajoth.
4And Ada bore Eliphaz: Basemath bore
Rahuel.
5Oolibama bore Jehus, and Ihelon, and Core.
These are the sons of Esau, that were born to
him in the land of Chanaan.
6And Esau took his wives, and his sons and
daughters, and every soul of his house, and his
substance, and cattle, and all that he was able
to acquire in the land of Chanaan: and went into
another country, and departed from his brother
Jacob.
7For they were exceeding rich, and could not
dwell together: neither was the land in which
they sojourned able to bear them, for the multi-
tude of their 
ocks.
8And Esau dwelt in mount Seir: he is Edom.
9And these are the generations of Esau, the
father of Edom, in mount Seir.
10And these the names of his sons: Eliphaz
the son of Ada, the wife of Esau: and Rahuel,
the son of Basemath, his wife.
11And Eliphaz had sons: Theman, Omar,
Sepho, and Gatham and Cenez.
12And Thamna was the concubine of Eliphaz,
the son of Esau: and she bore him Amalech.
These are the sons of Ada, the wife of Esau.
13And the sons of Rahuel were Nahath and
Zara, Samma and Meza. These were the sons of
Basemath, the wife of Esau.
14And these were the sons of Oolibama, the
daughter of Ana, the daughter of Sebeon, the
wife of Esau, whom she bore to him, Jehus, and
Ihelon, and Core.
15These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the
sons of Eliphaz, the rstborn of Esau: duke The-
man, duke Omar, duke Sepho, duke Cenez,
16Duke Core, duke Gatham, duke Amalech:
these are the sons of Eliphaz, in the land of
Edom, and these the sons of Ada.
17And these were the sons of Rahuel, the son
of Esau: duke Nahath, duke Zara, duke Samma,
duke Meza. And these are the dukes of Rahuel,
in the land of Edom: these the sons of Basemath,
the wife of Esau.
18And these the sons of Oolibama, the wife
of Esau: duke Jehus, duke Ihelon, duke Core.
These are the dukes of Oolibama, the daughter
of Ana, and wife of Esau.
19These are the sons of Esau, and these the
dukes of them: the same is Edom.
20These are the sons of Seir, the Horrite, the
inhabitants of the land: Lotan, and Sobal, and
Sebeon, and Ana,
21And Dison, and Eser, and Disan. These
are dukes of the Horrites, the sons of Seir, in the
land of Edom.
22And Lotan had sons: Hori and Heman.
And the sister of Lotan was Thamna.
23And these the sons of Sobal: Alvan, and
Manahat, and Ebal, and Sepho, and Onam.
24And these the sons of Sebeon: Aia and
Ana. This is Ana that found the hot waters in
the wilderness, when he fed the asses of Sebeon,
his father:
25And he had a son Dison, and a daughter
Oolibama.
26And these were the sons of Dison: Hamdan,
and Eseban, and Jethram, and Charan.
27These also were the sons of Eser: Balaan,
and Zavan, and Acan.
28And Dison had sons: Hus and Aram.
29These were dukes of the Horrites: duke
Lotan, duke Sobal, duke Sebeon, duke Ana,
30Duke Dison, duke Eser, duke Disan: these
were dukes of the Horrites that ruled in the land
of Seir.
31And the kings that ruled in the land of
Edom, before the children of Israel had a king,were these:
32Bela the son of Beor, and the name of his
city Denaba.
33And Bela died, and Jobab, the son of Zara,
of Bosra, reigned in his stead.
34And when Jobab was dead, Husam, of the
land of the Themanites, reigned in his stead.
35And after his death, Adad, the son of
Badad, reigned in his stead, who defeated the
Madianites in the country of Boab; and the name
of his city was Avith.
36And when Adad was dead, there reigned
in his stead, Semla, of Masreca.
37And he being dead, Saul, of the river Ro-
hoboth, reigned in his stead.
38And when he also was dead, Balanan, the
son of Achobor, succeeded to the kingdom.
39This man also being dead, Adar reigned in
his place; and the name of his city was Phau:
and his wife was called Meetabel, the daughter
of Matred, daughter of Mezaab.
40And these are the names of the dukes of
Esau in their kindreds, and places, and callings:
duke Thamna, duke Alva, duke Jetheth,
41Duke Oolibama, duke Ela, duke Phinon,
42Duke Cenez, duke Theman, duke Mabsar,
43Duke Magdiel, duke Hiram: these are the
dukes of Edom dwelling in the land of their gov-
ernment; the same is Esau, the father of the
Edomites.
Chapter 37
And Jacob dwelt in the land of Chanaan,
wherein his father sojourned.
2And these are his generations: Joseph, when
he was sixteen years old, was feeding the 
ock
with his brethren, being but a boy: and he was
with the sons of Bala and of Zelpha his father's
wives: and he accused his brethren to his father
of a most wicked crime.
3Now Israel loved Joseph above all his sons,
because he had him in his old age: and he made
him a coat of divers colours.
4And his brethren seeing that he was loved
by his father, more than all his sons, hated hem,
and could not speak peaceably to him.
5Now it fell out also that he told his brethren
a dream, that he had dreamed: which occasioned
them to hate him the more.
6And he said to them: Hear my dream which
I dreamed.
7I thought we were binding sheaves in the
eld: and my sheaf arose as it were, and stood,
and your sheaves standing about bowed down
before my sheaf.
8His brethren answered: Shalt thou be our
king? or shall we be subject to thy dominion?
Therefore this matter of his dreams and words
ministered nourishment to their envy and ha-
tred.
9He dreamed also another dream, which he
told his brethren, saying: I saw in a dream, as
it were the sun, and the moon, and eleven stars
worshipping me.
10And when he had told this to his fa-
ther, and brethren, his father rebuked him and
said: What meaneth this dream that thou hast
dreamed? shall I and thy mother, and thy
brethren worship thee upon the earth?
11His brethren therefore envied him: but his
father considered the thing with himself.
12And when his brethren abode in Sechem,
feeding their father's 
ocks,
13Israel said to him: Thy brethren feed the
sheep in Sichem: come, I will send thee to them.
And when he answered:
14I am ready: he said to him: Go, and see
if all things be well with thy brethren, and thecattle: and bring me word again what is doing.
So being sent from the vale of Hebron, he came
to Sichem:
15And a man found him there wandering in
the eld, and asked what he sought.
16But he answered: I seek my brethren, tell
me where they feed the 
ocks.
17And the man said to him: They are de-
parted from this place: for I heard them say:
Let us go to Dothain. And Joseph went forward
after his brethren, and found them in Dothain.
18And when they saw him afar o, before he
came nigh them, they thought to kill him:
19And said one to another: Behold the
dreamer cometh.
20Come, let us kill him, and cast him into
some old pit: and we will say: Some evil beast
hath devoured him: and then it shall appear
what his dreams avail him:
21And Ruben hearing this, endeavoured to
deliver him out of their hands, and said:
22Do not take away his life, nor shed his
blood: but cast him into this pit, that is in the
wilderness, and keep your hands harmless: now
he said this, being desirous to deliver him out of
their hands and to restore him to his father.
23And as soon as he came to his brethren,
they forthwith stript him of his outside coat, that
was of divers colours:
24And cast him into an old pit where there
was not water.
25And sitting down to eat bread, they
saw some Ismaelites on their way coming from
Galaad, with their camels, carrying spices, and
balm, and myrrh to Egypt.
26And Juda said to his brethren: What will
it prot us to kill our brother, and conceal his
blood?
27It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites,
and that our hands be not deled: for he is our
brother and our 
esh. His brethren agreed to his
words.
28And when the Madianite merchants passed
by, they drew him out of the pit, and sold him
to the Ismaelites, for twenty pieces of silver: and
they led him into Egypt.
29And Ruben returning to the pit, found not
the boy:
30And rending his garments he went to his
brethren, and said: The boy doth not appear,
and whither shall I go?
31And they took his coat, and dipped it in
the blood of a kid, which they had killed:
32Sending some to carry it to their father,
and to say: This we have found: see whether it
be thy son's coat, or not.
33And the father acknowledging it, said: It
is my son's coat, an evil wild beast hath eaten
him, a beast hath devoured Joseph.
34And tearing his garments, he put on sack-
cloth, mourning for his son a long time.
35And all his children being gathered to-
gether to comfort their father in his sorrow, he
would not receive comfort, but said: I will go
down to my son into hell, mourning. And whilst
he continued weeping,
36The Madianites sold Joseph in Egypt to
Putiphar, an eunuch of Pharao, captain of the
soldiers.
Chapter 38
At that time Juda went down from his brethren,
and turned in to a certain Odollamite, named
Hiras.
2And he saw there the daughter of a man of
Chanaan, called Sue: and taking her to wife, he
went in unto her.3And she conceived, and bore a son, and
called his name Her.
4And conceiving again, she bore a son, and
called him Onan.
5She bore also a third: whom she called Sela.
After whose birth, she ceased to bear any more.
6And Juda took a wife for Her, his rst born,
whose name was Thamar.
7And Her, the rst born of Juda, was wicked
in the sight of the Lord: and was slain by him.
8Juda, therefore, said to Onan his son: Go in
to thy brother's wife and marry her, that thou
mayst raise seed to thy brother.
9He knowing that the children should not be
his, when he went in to his brother's wife, he
spilled his seed upon the ground, lest children
should be born in his brother's name.
10And therefore the Lord slew him, because
he did a detestable thing:
11Wherefore Juda said to Thamar his
daughter-in-law: Remain a widow in thy father's
house, till Sela my son grow up: for he was afraid
lest he also might die, as his brethren did. She
went her way, and dwelt in her father's house.
12And after many days were past: the daugh-
ter of Sue the wife of Juda died: and when he
had taken comfort after his mourning, he went
up to Thamnas, to the shearers of his sheep, he
and Hiras the Odollamite, the shepherd of his

ock.
13And it was told Thamar that her father-in-
law was come up to Thamnas to shear his sheep.
14And she put o the garments of her widow-
hood, and took a veil: and changing her dress,
sat in the cross way, that leadeth to Thamnas:
because Sela was grown up, and she had not been
married to him.
15When Juda saw her, he thought she was
a harlot: for she had covered her face, lest she
should be known.
16And going to her, he said: Suer me to
lie with thee: for he knew her not to be his
daughter-in-law. And she answered: What wilt
thou give me to enjoy my company?
17He said: I will send thee a kid out of the

ock. And when she said again: I will suer
what thou wilt, if thou give me a pledge, till
thou send what thou promisest.
18Juda said: What wilt thou have for a
pledge? She answered: Thy ring and bracelet,
and the sta which thou holdest in thy hand.
The woman therefore at one copulation con-
ceived.
19And she arose and went her way: and
putting o the apparel which she had taken, put
on the garments of her widowhood.
20And Juda sent a kid by his shepherd, the
Odollamite, that he might receive the pledge
again, which he had given to the woman: but
he, not nding her,
21Asked the men of that place: Where is the
woman that sat in the cross way? And when
they all made answer: There was no harlot in
this place,
22He returned to Juda, and said to him: I
have not found her; moreover, the men of that
place said to me, that there never sat a harlot
there.
23Juda said: Let her take it to herself, surely
she cannot charge us with a lie, I sent the kid
which I promised: and thou didst not nd her.
24And behold, after three months, they told
Juda, saying: Thamar, thy daughter-in-law,
hath played the harlot, and she appeareth to
have a big belly. And Juda said: Bring her out
that she may be burnt.
25But when she was led to execution, she
sent to her father in law, saying: By the man, to
whom these things belong, I am with child. See
whose ring, and bracelet, and sta this is.26But he acknowledging the gifts, said: She
is juster than I: because I did not give her to
Sela, my son. However he knew her no more.
27And when she was ready to be brought to
bed, there appeared twins in her womb: and in
the very delivery of the infants, one put forth a
hand, whereon the midwife tied a scarlet thread,
saying:
28This shall come forth the rst.
29But he drawing back his hand, the other
came forth: and the woman said: Why is the
partition divided for thee? and therefore called
his name Phares.
30Afterwards his brother came out, on whose
hand was the scarlet thread: and she called his
name Zara.
Chapter 39
And Joseph was brought into Egypt, and
Putiphar, an eunuch of Pharao, chief captain of
the army, an Egyptian, bought him of the Is-
maelites, by whom he was brought.
2And the Lord was with him, and he was a
prosperous man in all things: and he dwelt in
his master's house:
3Who knew very well that the Lord was with
him, and made all that he did to prosper in his
hand.
4And Joseph found favour in the sight of his
master, and ministered to him: and being set
over all by him, he governed the house commit-
ted to him, and all things that were delivered to
him:
5And the Lord blessed the house of the Egyp-
tian for Joseph's sake, and multiplied all his sub-
stance, both at home and in the elds.
6Neither knew he any other thing, but the
bread which he ate. And Joseph was of a beau-
tiful countenance, and comely to behold.
7And after many days, his mistress cast her
eyes on Joseph, and said: Lie with me.
8But he in no wise consenting to that wicked
act said to her: Behold, my master hath deliv-
ered all things to me, and knoweth not what he
hath in his own house:
9Neither is there any thing which is not in
my power, or that he hath not delivered to me,
but thee, who art his wife; how then can I do
this wicked thing, and sin against my God?
10With such words as these day by day, both
the woman was importunate with the young
man, and he refused the adultery.
11Now it happened on a certain day, that
Joseph went into the house, and was doing some
business, without any man with him:
12And she catching the skirt of his garment,
said: Lie with me. But he leaving the garment
in her hand, 
ed, and went out.
13And when the woman saw the garment in
her hands, and herself disregarded,
14She called to her the men of her house, and
said to them: See, he hath brought in a Hebrew,
to abuse us: he came in to me, to lie with me;
and when I cried out,
15And he heard my voice, he left the garment
that I held, and got him out.
16For a proof therefore of her delity, she
kept the garment, and shewed it to her husband
when he returned home:
17And said: The Hebrew servant, whom thou
hast brought, came to me to abuse me.
18And when he heard me cry, he left the gar-
ment which I held, and 
ed out.
19His master hearing these things, and giving
too much credit to his wife's words, was very
angry,
20And cast Joseph into the prison, where the
king's prisoners were kept, and he was there shutup.
21But the Lord was with Joseph, and having
mercy upon him gave him favour in the sight of
the chief keeper of the prison:
22Who delivered into his hand all the prison-
ers that were kept in custody: and whatsoever
was done, was under him.
23Neither did he himself know any thing, hav-
ing committed all things to him: for the Lord
was with him, and made all that he did to pros-
per.
Chapter 40
After this, it came to pass, that two eunuchs,
the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt,
oended their lord.
2And Pharao being angry with them, (now
the one was chief butler, the other chief baker,)
3He sent them to the prison of the commander
of the soldiers, in which Joseph also was prisoner.
4But the keeper of the prison delivered them
to Joseph, and he served them. Some little time
passed, and they were kept in custody.
5And they both dreamed a dream the same
night, according to the interpretation agreeing
to themselves:
6And when Joseph was come into them in the
morning, and saw them sad,
7He asked them, saying: Why is your coun-
tenance sadder today than usual?
8They answered: We have dreamed a dream,
and there is nobody to interpret it to us. And
Joseph said to them: Doth not interpretation
belong to God? Tell me what you have dreamed:
9The chief butler rst told his dream: I saw
before me a vine,
10On which were three branches, which by
little and little sent out buds, and after the blos-
soms brought forth ripe grapes:
11And the cup of Pharao was in my hand:
and I took the grapes, and pressed them into the
cup which I held, and I gave the cup to Pharao.
12Joseph answered: This is the interpretation
of the dream: The three branches, are yet three
days:
13After which Pharao will remember thy ser-
vice, and will restore thee to thy former place:
and thou shalt present him the cup according to
thy oce, as before thou was wont to do.
14Only remember me when it shall be well
with thee, and do me this kindness: to put
Pharao in mind to take me out of this prison:
15For I was stolen away out of the land of the
Hebrews, and here without any fault was cast
into the dungeon.
16The chief baker seeing that he had wisely
interpreted the dream, said: I also dreamed a
dream, That I had three baskets of meal upon
my head:
17And that in one basket which was upper-
most, I carried all meats that are made by the
art of baking, and that the birds ate out of it.
18Joseph answered: This is the interpretation
of the dream: The three baskets, are yet three
days:
19After which Pharao will take thy head from
thee, and hang thee on a cross, and the birds
shall tear thy 
esh.
20The third day after this was the birthday
of Pharao: and he made a great feast for his
servants, and at the banquet remembered the
chief butler, and the chief baker.
21And he restored the one to his place, to
present him the cup:
22The other he hanged on a gibbet, that the
truth of the interpreter might be shewn.
23But the chief butler, when things prospered
with him, forgot his interpreter.Chapter 41
After two years Pharao had a dream. He thought
he stood by the river,
2Out of which came up seven kine, very beau-
tiful and fat: and they fed in marshy places.
3Other seven also came up out of the river, ill
favoured, and lean 
eshed: and they fed on the
very bank of the river, in green places:
4And they devoured them, whose bodies were
very beautiful and well conditioned. So Pharao
awoke.
5He slept again, and dreamed another dream:
Seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk full
and fair:
6Then seven other ears sprung up thin and
blasted,
7And devoured all the beauty of the former.
Pharao awaked after his rest:
8And when morning was come, being struck
with fear, he sent to all the interpreters of Egypt,
and to all the wise men: and they being called
for, he told them his dream, and there was not
any one that could interpret it.
9Then at length the chief butler remember-
ing, said: I confess my sin:
10The king being angry with his servants,
commanded me and the chief baker to be cast
into the prison of the captain of the soldiers.
11Where in one night both of us dreamed a
dream forboding things to come.
12There was there a young man a Hebrew,
servant to the same captain of the soldiers: to
whom we told our dreams,
13And we heard what afterwards the event
of the thing proved to be so. For I was restored
to my oce: and he was hanged upon a gibbet.
14Forthwith at the king's command Joseph
was brought out of the prison, and they shaved
him: and changing his apparel brought him in
to him.
15And he said to him: I have dreamed
dreams, and there is no one that can expound
them: Now I have heard that thou art very wise
at interpreting them:
16Joseph answered: Without me, God shall
give Pharao a prosperous answer.
17So Pharao told what he had dreamed:
Methought I stood upon the bank of the river,
18And seven kine came up out of the river,
exceeding beautiful and full of 
esh: and they
grazed on green places in a marshy pasture.
19And behold, there followed these, other
seven kine, so very ill favoured and lean, that
I never saw the like in the land of Egypt:
20And they devoured and consumed the for-
mer,
21And yet gave no mark of their being full:
but were as lean and ill favoured as before. I
awoke, and then fell asleep again,
22And dreamed a dream: Seven ears of corn
grew up upon one stalk, full and very fair.
23Other seven also thin and blasted, sprung
of the stalk:
24And they devoured the beauty of the for-
mer: I told this dream to the conjecturers, and
there is no man that can expound it.
25Joseph answered: The king's dream is one:
God hath shewn to Pharao what he is about to
do.
26The seven beautiful kine, and the seven full
ears, are seven years of plenty: and both contain
the same meaning of the dream.
27And the seven lean and thin kine that came
up after them, and the seven thin ears that were
blasted with the burning wind, are seven years
of famine to come:
28Which shall be fullled in this order.29Behold, there shall come seven years of
great plenty in the whole land of Egypt:
30After which shall follow other seven years
of so great scarcity, that all the abundance before
shall be forgotten: for the famine shall consume
all the land,
31And the greatness of the scarcity shall de-
stroy the greatness of the plenty.
32And for that thou didst see the second time
a dream pertaining to the same thing: it is a
token of the certainty, and that the word of God
cometh to pass, and is fullled speedily.
33Now therefore let the king provide a wise
and industrious man, and make him ruler over
the land of Egypt:
34That he may appoint overseers over all the
countries: and gather into barns the fth part of
the fruits, during the seven fruitful years,
35That shall now presently ensue: and let all
the corn be laid up, under Pharao's hands, and
be reserved in the cities.
36And let it be in readiness, against the
famine of seven years to come, which shall op-
press Egypt, and the land shall not be consumed
with scarcity.
37The counsel pleased Pharao, and all his
servants.
38And he said to them: Can we nd such
another man, that is full of the spirit of God?
39He said therefore to Joseph: Seeing God
hath shewn thee all that thou hast said, can I
nd one wiser and one like unto thee?
40Thou shalt be over my house, and at the
commandment of thy mouth all the people shall
obey: only in the kingly throne will I be above
thee.
41And again Pharao said to Joseph: Behold,
I have appointed thee over the whole land of
Egypt.
42And he took his ring from his own hand,
and gave it into his hand: and he put upon him
a robe of silk, and put a chain of gold about his
neck.
43And he made him go up into his second
chariot, the crier proclaiming that all should bow
their knee before him, and that they should know
he was made governor over the whole land of
Egypt.
44And the king said to Joseph: I am Pharao:
without thy commandment no man shall move
hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
45And he turned his name, and called him
in the Egyptian tongue the saviour of the world.
And he gave him to wife Aseneth, the daughter
of Putiphare, priest of Heliopolis. Then Joseph
went out to the land of Egypt.
46(Now he was thirty years old when he stood
before king Pharao), and he went round all the
countries of Egypt.
47And the fruitfulness of the seven years
came: and the corn being bound up into sheaves,
was gathered together into the barns of Egypt.
48And all the abundance of grain was laid up
in every city.
49And there was so great abundance of
wheat, that it was equal to the sand of the sea,
and the plenty exceeded measure.
50And before the famine came, Joseph had
two sons born: whom Aseneth, the daughter of
Putiphare, priest of Heliopolis, bore unto him.
51And he called the name of the rstborn
Manasses, saying: God hath made me to forget
all my labours, and my father's house.
52And he named the second Ephraim, saying:
God hath made me to grow in the land of my
poverty.
53Now when the seven years of plenty that
had been in Egypt were passed:
54The seven years of scarcity, which Josephhad foretold, began to come: and the famine
prevailed in the whole world, but there was bread
in all the land of Egypt.
55And when there also they began to be fam-
ished, the people cried to Pharao, for food. And
he said to them: Go to Joseph: and do all that
he shall say to you.
56And the famine increased daily in all the
land: and Joseph opened all the barns, and sold
to the Egyptians: for the famine had oppressed
them also.
57And all provinces came into Egypt, to buy
food, and to seek some relief of their want.
Chapter 42
And Jacob hearing that food was sold in Egypt,
said to his sons: Why are ye careless?
2I have heard that wheat is sold in Egypt:
Go ye down, and buy us necessaries, that we
may live, and not be consumed with want.
3So the ten brethren of Joseph went down, to
buy corn in Egypt:
4Whilst Benjamin was kept at home by Ja-
cob, who said to his brethren: Lest perhaps he
take any harm in the journey.
5And they entered into the land of Egypt with
others that went to buy. For the famine was in
the land of Chanaan.
6And Joseph was governor in the land of
Egypt, and corn was sold by his direction to the
people. And when his brethren had bowed down
to him,
7And he knew them, he spoke as it were
to strangers, somewhat roughly, asking them:
Whence came you? They answered: From the
land of Chanaan, to buy necessaries of life.
8And though he knew his brethren, he was
not known by them.
9And remembering the dreams, which for-
merly he had dreamed, he said to them: You are
spies. You are come to view the weaker parts of
the land.
10But they said: It is not so, my lord; but
thy servants are come to buy food.
11We are all the sons of one man: we are
come as peaceable men, neither do thy servants
go about any evil.
12And he answered them: It is otherwise:
you are come to consider the unfenced parts of
this land.
13But they said: We thy servants are twelve
brethren, the sons of one man in the land of
Chanaan: the youngest is with our father, the
other is not living.
14He saith, This is it that I said: You are
spies.
15I shall now presently try what you are: by
the health of Pharao, you shall not depart hence,
until your youngest brother come.
16Send one of you to fetch him: and you shall
be in prison, till what you have said be proved,
whether it be true or false: or else by the health
of Pharao you are spies.
17So he put them in prison three days.
18And the third day he brought them out of
prison, and said: Do as I have said, and you shall
live: for I fear God.
19If you be peaceable men, let one of your
brethren be bound in prison: and go ye your
ways, and carry the corn that you have bought,
unto your houses.
20And bring your youngest brother to me,
that I may nd your words to be true, and you
may not die. They did as he had said.
21And they talked one to another: We de-
serve to suer these things, because we have
sinned against our brother, seeing the anguish
of his soul, when he besought us, and we wouldnot hear: therefore is this aiction come upon
us.
22And Ruben, one of them, said: Did not I
say to you: Do not sin against the boy; and you
would not hear me? Behold his blood is required.
23And they knew not that Joseph under-
stood, because he spoke to them by an inter-
preter.
24And he turned himself away a little while,
and wept: and returning, he spoke to them.
25And taking Simeon, and binding him in
their presence, he commanded his servants to ll
their sacks with wheat, and to put every man's
money again in their sacks, and to give them
besides provisions for the way: and they did so.
26But they having loaded their asses with the
corn went their way.
27And one of them opening his sack, to give
his beast provender in the inn, saw the money in
the sack's mouth,
28And said to his brethren: My money is
given me again; behold it is in the sack. And
they were astonished, and troubled, and said to
one another: What is this that God hath done
unto us?
29And they came to Jacob their father in the
land of Chanaan, and they told him all things
that had befallen them, saying:
30The lord of the land spoke roughly to us,
and took us to be spies of the country.
31And we answered him: We are peaceable
men, and we mean no plot.
32We are twelve brethren born of one father:
one is not living, the youngest is with our father
in the land of Chanaan.
33And he said to us: Hereby shall I know
that you are peaceable men: Leave one of your
brethren with me, and take ye necessary provi-
sion for your houses, and go your ways,
34And bring your youngest brother to me,
that I may know you are not spies: and you may
receive this man again, that is kept in prison:
and afterwards may have leave to buy what you
will.
35When they had told this, they poured out
their corn, and every man found his money tied
in the mouth of his sack: and all being aston-
ished together,
36Their father Jacob said: You have made
me to be without children: Joseph is not living,
Simeon is kept in bonds, and Benjamin you will
take away: all these evils are fallen upon me.
37And Ruben answered him: Kill my two
sons, if I bring him not again to thee: deliver
him into my hand, and I will restore him to thee.
38But he said: My son shall not go down with
you: his brother is dead, and he is left alone:
if any mischief befall him in the land to which
you go, you will bring down my grey hairs with
sorrow to hell.
Chapter 43
In the mean time the famine was heavy upon all
the land.
2And when they had eaten up all the corn,
which they had brought out of Egypt, Jacob said
to his sons: Go again, and buy us a little food.
3Juda answered: The man declared unto us
with the attestation of an oath, saying: You shall
not see my face, unless you bring your youngest
brother with you.
4If therefore thou wilt send him with us, we
will set out together, and will buy necessaries for
thee.
5But if thou wilt not, we will not go: for the
man, as we have often said, declared unto us,
saying: You shall not see my face without youryoungest brother.
6Israel said to them: You have done this for
my misery, in that you told him you had also
another brother.
7But they answered: The man asked us in or-
der concerning our kindred: if our father lived:
if we had a brother: and we answered him reg-
ularly, according to what he demanded: could
we know that he would say: Bring hither your
brother with you?
8And Juda said to his father: Send the boy
with me, that we may set forward, and may live:
lest both we and our children perish.
9I take the boy upon me, require him at my
hand: unless I bring him again, and restore him
to thee, I will be guilty of sin against thee for
ever.
10If delay had not been made, we had been
here again the second time.
11Then Israel said to them: If it must needs
be so, do what you will: take of the best fruits of
the land in your vessels, and carry down presents
to the man, a little balm, and honey, and storax,
myrrh, turpentine, and almonds.
12And take with you double money, and carry
back what you found in your sacks, lest perhaps
it was done by mistake.
13And take also your brother, and go to the
man.
14And may my almighty God make him
favourable to you: and send back with you your
brother, whom he keepeth, and this Benjamin:
and as for me I shall be desolate without chil-
dren.
15So the men took the presents, and dou-
ble money, and Benjamin: and went down into
Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
16And when he had seen them, and Benjamin
with them, he commanded the steward of his
house, saying: Bring in the men into the house,
and kill victims, and prepare a feast: because
they shall eat with me at noon.
17He did as he was commanded, and brought
the men into the house.
18And they being much afraid, said there
one to another: Because of the money, which
we carried back the rst time in our sacks, we
are brought in: that he may bring upon us a
false accusation, and by violence make slaves of
us and our asses.
19Wherefore, going up to the steward of the
house, at the door,
20They said: Sir, we desire thee to hear us.
We came down once before to buy food:
21And when we had bought, and were come
to the inn, we opened our sacks, and found our
money in the mouths of the sacks: which we have
now brought again in the same weight.
22And we have brought other money besides,
to buy what we want: we cannot tell who put it
in our bags.
23But he answered: Peace be with you, fear
not: your God, and the God of your father, hath
given you treasure in your sacks. For the money,
which you gave me, I have for good. And he
brought Simeon out to them.
24And having brought them into the house,
he fetched water, and they washed their feet, and
he gave provender to their asses.
25But they made ready the presents, against
Joseph came at noon: for they had heard that
they should eat bread there.
26Then Joseph came in to his house, and they
oered him the presents, holding them in their
hands; and they bowed down with their face to
the ground.
27But he courteously saluting them again,
asked them, saying: Is the old man your father
in health, of whom you told me? Is he yet living?28And they answered: Thy servant our fa-
ther, is in health; he is yet living. And bowing
themselves, they made obeisance to him.
29And Joseph lifting up his eyes, saw Ben-
jamin, his brother by the same mother, and said:
Is this your young brother, of whom you told me?
And he said: God be gracious to thee, my son.
30And he made haste, because his heart was
moved upon his brother, and tears gushed out:
and going into his chamber, he wept.
31And when he had washed his face, coming
out again, he refrained himself, and said: Set
bread on the table.
32And when it was set on, for Joseph apart,
and for his brethren apart, for the Egyptians also
that ate with him apart, (for it is unlawful for
the Egyptians to eat with the Hebrews, and they
think such a feast profane):
33They sat before him, the rstborn accord-
ing to his birthright, and the youngest according
to his age. And they wondered very much;
34Taking the messes which they received of
him: and the greater mess came to Benjamin, so
that it exceeded by ve parts. And they drank,
and were merry with him.
Chapter 44
And Joseph commanded the steward of his
house, saying: Fill their sacks with corn, as much
as they can hold: and put the money of every one
in the top of his sack.
2And in the mouth of the younger's sack put
my silver cup, and the price which he gave for
the wheat. And it was so done.
3And when the morning arose, they were sent
away with their asses.
4And when they were now departed out of the
city, and had gone forward a little way: Joseph
sending for the steward of his house, said: Arise,
and pursue after the men: and when thou hast
overtaken them, say to them: Why have you re-
turned evil for good?
5The cup which you have stolen, is that in
which my lord drinketh, and in which he is wont
to divine: you have done a very evil thing.
6He did as he had commanded him. And
having overtaken them, he spoke to them the
same words.
7And they answered: Why doth our lord
speak so, as though thy servants had commit-
ted so heinous a fact?
8The money, that we found in the top of our
sacks, we brought back to thee from the land of
Chanaan: how then should it be that we should
steal out of thy lord's house, gold or silver?
9With whomsoever of thy servants shall be
found that which thou seekest, let him die, and
we will be the bondmen of my lord.
10And he said to them: Let it be according
to your sentence: with whomsoever it shall be
found, let him be my servant, and you shall be
blameless.
11Then they speedily took down their sacks
to the ground, and every man opened his sack.
12Which when he had searched, beginning at
the eldest, and ending at the youngest, he found
the cup in Benjamin's sack.
13Then they rent their garments, and loading
their asses again, returned into the town.
14And Juda at the head of his brethren went
in to Joseph (for he was not yet gone out of the
place) and they all together fell down before him
on the ground.
15And he said to them: Why would you do
so? know you not that there is no one like me in
the science of divining.
16And Juda said to him: What shall we an-
swer my lord? or what shall we say, or be ablejustly to allege? God hath found out the iniq-
uity of thy servants: behold, we are all bondmen
to my lord, both we, and he with whom the cup
was found.
17Joseph answered: God forbid that I should
do so: he that stole the cup, he shall be my
bondman: and go you away free to your father.
18Then Juda coming nearer, said boldly: I
beseech thee, my lord, let thy servant speak a
word in thy ears, and be not angry with thy ser-
vant: for after Pharao thou art.
19My lord. Thou didst ask thy servants the
rst time: Have you a father or a brother.
20And we answered thee, my lord: We have
a father an old man, and a young boy, that was
born in his old age; whose brother by the mother
is dead; and he alone is left of his mother, and
his father loveth him tenderly.
21And thou saidst to thy servants: Bring him
hither to me, and I will set my eyes on him.
22We suggested to my lord: The boy cannot
leave his father: for if he leave him, he will die.
23And thou saidst to thy servants: Except
your youngest brother come with you, you shall
see my face no more.
24Therefore when we were gone up to thy
servant our father, we told him all that my lord
had said.
25And our father said: Go again, and buy us
a little wheat.
26And we said to him: We cannot go: if our
youngest brother go down with us, we will set
out together: otherwise, without him we dare
not see the man's face.
27Whereunto he answered: You know that
my wife bore me two.
28One went out, and you said: A beast de-
voured him; and hitherto he appeareth not.
29If you take this also, and any thing befall
him in the way, you will bring down my grey
hairs with sorrow unto hell.
30Therefore, if I shall go to thy servant, our
father, and the boy be wanting, (whereas his life
dependeth upon the life of him,)
31And he shall see that he is not with us, he
will die, and thy servants shall bring down his
grey hairs with sorrow unto hell.
32Let me be thy proper servant, who took
him into my trust, and promised, saying: If I
bring him not again, I will be guilty of sin against
my father for ever.
33Therefore I, thy servant, will stay instead
of the boy in the service of my lord, and let the
boy go up with his brethren.
34For I cannot return to my father without
the boy, lest I be a witness of the calamity that
will oppress my father.
Chapter 45
Joseph could no longer refrain himself before
many that stood by: whereupon he commanded
that all should go out, and no stranger be present
at their knowing one another.
2And he lifted up his voice with weeping,
which the Egyptians, and all the house of Pharao
heard.
3And he said to his brethren: I am Joseph:
Is my father yet living? His brethren could not
answer him, being struck with exceeding great
fear.
4And he said mildly to them: Come nearer
to me. And when they were come near him, he
said: I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold
into Egypt.
5Be not afraid, and let it not seem to you a
hard case that you sold me into these countries:
for God sent me before you into Egypt for your
preservation.6For it is two years since the famine began to
be upon the land, and ve years more remain,
wherein there can be neither ploughing nor reap-
ing.
7And God sent me before, that you may be
preserved upon the earth, and may have food to
live.
8Not by your counsel was I sent hither, but
by the will of God: who hath made me as it were
a father to Pharao, and lord of his whole house,
and governor in all the land of Egypt.
9Make haste, and go ye up to my father, and
say to him: Thus saith thy son Joseph: God hath
made me lord of the whole land of Egypt; come
down to me, linger not.
10And thou shalt dwell in the land of Gessen:
and thou shalt be near me, thou and thy sons,
and thy sons' sons, thy sheep, and thy herds, and
all things that thou hast.
11And there I will feed thee, (for there are
yet ve years of famine remaining) lest both thou
perish, and thy house, and all things that thou
hast.
12Behold, your eyes, and the eyes of my
brother Benjamin, see that it is my mouth that
speaketh to you.
13You shall tell my father of all my glory, and
all things that you have seen in Egypt: make
haste and bring him to me.
14And falling upon the neck of his brother
Benjamin, he embraced him and wept: and Ben-
jamin in like manner wept also on his neck.
15And Joseph kissed all his brethren, and
wept upon every one of them: after which they
were emboldened to speak to him.
16And it was heard, and the fame was spread
abroad in the king's court: The brethren of
Joseph are come; and Pharao with all his family
was glad.
17And he spoke to Joseph that he should give
orders to his brethren, saying: Load your beasts,
and go into the land of Chanaan,
18And bring away from thence your father
and kindred, and come to me; and I will give
you all the good things of Egypt, that you may
eat the marrow of the land.
19Give orders also that they take wagons out
of the land of Egypt, for the carriage of their
children and their wives; and say: Take up your
father, and make haste to come with all speed:
20And leave nothing of your household stu;
for all the riches of Egypt shall be yours.
21And the sons of Israel did as they were
bid. And Joseph gave them wagons according to
Pharao's commandment: and provisions for the
way.
22He ordered also to be brought out for every
one of them two robes: but to Benjamin he gave
three hundred pieces of silver, with ve robes of
the best:
23Sending to his father as much money and
raiment; adding besides, ten he asses, to carry o
all the riches of Egypt, and as many she asses,
carrying wheat and bread for the journey.
24So he sent away his brethren, and at their
departing said to them: Be not angry in the way.
25And they went up out of Egypt, and came
into the land of Chanaan, to their father Jacob.
26And they told him, saying: Joseph, thy
son, is living; and he is ruler in all the land of
Egypt. Which when Jacob heard, he awaked as
it were out of a deep sleep, yet did not believe
them.
27They, on the other side, told the whole
order of the thing. And when he saw the wagons,
and all that he had sent, his spirit revived,
28And he said: It is enough for me if Joseph,
my son, be yet living: I will go and see him before
I die.Chapter 46
And Israel taking his journey, with all that he
had, came to the well of the oath, and killing
victims there to the God of his father Isaac,
2He heard him, by a vision in the night, call-
ing him, and saying to him: Jacob, Jacob. And
he answered him: Lo, here I am.
3God said to him: I am the most mighty God
of thy father; fear not, go down into Egypt, for
I will make a great nation of thee there.
4I will go down with thee thither, and will
bring thee back again from thence: Joseph also
shall put his hands upon thy eyes.
5And Jacob rose up from the well of the oath:
and his sons took him up, with their children and
wives in the wagons, which Pharao had sent to
carry the old man,
6And all that he had in the land of Chanaan:
and he came into Egypt with all his seed;
7His sons, and grandsons, daughters, and all
his ospring together.
8And these are the names of the children of
Israel, that entered into Egypt, he and his chil-
dren. His rstborn Ruben,
9The sons of Ruben: Henoch and Phallu, and
Hesron and Charmi.
10The sons of Simeon: Jamuel and Jamin
and Ahod, and Jachin and Sohar, and Saul, the
son of a woman of Chanaan.
11The sons of Levi: Gerson and Caath, and
Merari.
12The sons of Juda: Her and Onan, and Sela,
and Phares and Zara. And Her and Onan died
in the land of Chanaan. And sons were born to
Phares: Hesron and Hamul.
13The sons of Issachar: Thola and Phua, and
Job and Semron.
14The sons of Zabulon: Sared, and Elon, and
Jahelel.
15These are the sons of Lia, whom she bore in
Mesopotamia of Syria, with Dina, his daughter.
All the souls of her sons and daughters, thirty-
three.
16The sons of Gad: Sephion and Haggi, and
Suni and Esebon, and Heri and Arodi, and Areli.
17The sons of Aser: Jamne and Jesua, and
Jessuri and Beria, and Sara their sister. The
sons of Beria: Heber and Melchiel.
18These are the sons of Zelpha, whom Laban
gave to Lia, his daughter. And these she bore to
Jacob, sixteen souls.
19The sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife: Joseph
and Benjamin.
20And sons were born to Joseph, in the
land of Egypt, whom Aseneth, the daughter of
Putiphare, priest of Heliopolis, bore him: Man-
asses and Ephraim.
21The sons of Benjamin: Bela and Bechor,
and Asbel and Gera, and Naaman and Echi, and
Ross and Mophim, and Ophim and Ared.
22These are the sons of Rachel, whom she
bore to Jacob: all the souls, fourteen.
23The sons of Dan: Husim.
24The sons of Nephthali: Jaziel and Guni,
and Jeser and Sallem.
25These are the sons of Bala, whom Laban
gave to Rachel, his daughter: and these she bore
to Jacob: all the souls, seven.
26All the souls that went with Jacob into
Egypt, and that came out of his thigh, besides
his sons' wives, sixty-six.
27And the sons of Joseph, that were born to
him in the land of Egypt, two souls. All the souls
of the house of Jacob, that entered into Egypt,
were seventy.
28And he sent Juda before him to Joseph, to
tell him; and that he should meet him in Gessen.
29And when he was come thither, Joseph
made ready his chariot, and went up to meethis father in the same place: and seeing him, he
fell upon his neck, and embracing him, wept.
30And the father said to Joseph: Now shall
I die with joy, becuase I have seen thy face, and
leave thee alive.
31And Joseph said to his brethren, and to
all his father's house: I will go up, and will
tell Pharao, and will say to him: My brethren,
and my father's house, that were in the land of
Chanaan, are come to me:
32And the men are shepherds, and their oc-
cupation is to feed cattle; their 
ocks, and herds,
and all they have, they have brought with them.
33And when he shall call you, and shall say:
What is your occupation?
34You shall answer: We, thy servants, are
shepherds, from our infancy until now, both we
and our fathers. And this you shall say, that
you may dwell in the land of Gessen, because the
Egyptians have all shepherds in abomination.
Chapter 47
Then Joseph went in and told Pharao, saying:
My father and brethren, their sheep and their
herds, and all that they possess, are come out of
the land of Chanaan: and behold they stay in
the land of Gessen.
2Five men also, the last of his brethren, he
presented before the king:
3And he asked them: What is your occu-
pation? They answered: We, thy servants, are
shepherds, both we and our fathers.
4We are come to sojourn in thy land, because
there is no grass for the 
ocks of thy servants,
the famine being very grievous in the land of
Chanaan: and we pray thee to give orders that
we thy servants may be in the land of Gessen.
5The king therefore said to Joseph: Thy fa-
ther and thy brethren are come to thee.
6The land of Egypt is before thee: and make
them dwell in the best place, and give them the
land of Gessen. And if thou knowest that there
are industrious men among them, make them
rulers over my cattle.
7After this Joseph brought in his father to
the king, and presented him before him: and he
blessed him.
8And being asked by him: How many are the
days of the years of thy life?
9He answered: The days of my pilgrimage
are a hundred and thirty years, few, and evil,
and they are not come up to the days of the
pilgrimage of my fathers.
10And blessing the king, he went out.
11But Joseph gave a possession to his fa-
ther and his brethren in Egypt, in the best place
of the land, in Ramesses, as Pharao had com-
manded.
12And he nourished them, and all his father's
house, allowing food to every one.
13For in the whole world there was want
of bread, and a famine had oppressed the land,
more especially of Egypt and Chanaan;
14Out of which he gathered up all the money
for the corn which they bought, and brought it
in to the king's treasure.
15And when the buyers wanted money, all
Egypt came to Joseph, saying: Give us bread:
why should we die in thy presence, having now
no money?
16And he answered them: Bring me your cat-
tle, and for them I will give you food, if you have
no money.
17And when they had brought them, he gave
them food in exchange for their horses, and
sheep, and oxen, and asses: and he maintained
them that year for the exchange of their cattle.18And they came the second year, and said
to him: We will not hide from our lord, how that
our money is spent, and our cattle also are gone:
neither art thou ignorant that we have nothing
now left but our bodies and our lands.
19Why therefore shall we die before thy eyes?
we will be thine, both we and our lands: buy
us to be the king's servants, and give us seed,
lest for want of tillers the land be turned into a
wilderness.
20So Joesph bought all the land of Egypt,
every man selling his possessions, because of the
greatness of the famine. And he brought it into
Pharao's hands:
21And all its people from one end of the bor-
ders of Egypt, even to the other end thereof,
22Except the land of the priests, which had
been given them by the king: to whom also a
certain allowance of food was given out of the
public stores, and therefore they were not forced
to sell their possessions.
23Then Joseph said to the people: Behold,
as you see, both you and your lands belong to
Pharao; take seed and sow the elds,
24That you may have corn. The fth part
you shall give to the king; the other four you
shall have for seed, and for food for your families
and children.
25And they answered: our life is in thy hand;
only let my lord look favourably upon us, and we
will gladly serve the king.
26From that time unto this day, in the whole
land of Egypt, the fth part is paid to the kings,
and it is become as a law, except the land of the
priests, which was free from this covenant.
27So Israel dwelt in Egypt, that is, in the
land of Gessen, and possessed it; and grew, and
was multiplied exceedingly.
28And he lived in it seventeen years: and all
the days of his life came to a hundred and forty-
seven years.
29And when he saw that the day of his death
drew nigh, he called his son Joseph, and said
to him: If I have found favour in thy sight, put
thy hand under my thigh; and thou shalt shew
me this kindness and truth, not to bury me in
Egypt.
30But I will sleep with my fathers, and thou
shalt take me away out of this land, and bury
me in the burying place of my ancestors. And
Joseph answered him: I will do what thou hast
commanded.
31And he said: Swear then to me. And as he
was swearing, Israel adored God, turning to the
bed's head.
Chapter 48
After these things, it was told Joseph that his
father was sick; and he set out to go to him,
taking his two sons Manasses and Ephraim.
2And it was told the old man: Behold thy son
Joseph cometh to thee. And being strengthened,
he sat on his bed.
3And when Joseph was come in to him, he
said: God almighty apppeared to me at Luza,
which is in the land of Chanaan, and he blessed
me,
4And said: I will cause thee to increase and
multiply, and I will make of thee a multitude of
people: and I will give this land to thee, and to
thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.
5So thy two sons, who were born to thee in
the land of Egypt before I came hither to thee,
shall be mine: Ephraim and Manasses shall be
reputed to me as Ruben and Simeon.
6But the rest whom thou shalt have after
them, shall be thine, and shall be called by the
name of their brethren in their possessions.7For, when I came out of Mesopotamia,
Rachel died from me in the land of Chanaan in
the very journey, and it was spring time: and I
was going to Ephrata, and I buried her near the
way of Ephrata, which by another name is called
Bethlehem.
8Then seeing his sons, he said to him: Who
are these?
9He answered: They are my sons, whom God
hath given me in this place. And he said: Bring
them to me, that I may bless them.
10For Israel's eyes were dim by reason of his
great age, and he could not see clearly. And
when they were brought to him, he kissed and
embraced them,
11And said to his son: I am not deprived of
seeing thee; moreover God hath shewn me thy
seed.
12And when Joseph had taken them from his
father's lap, he bowed down with his face to the
ground.
13And he set Ephraim on his right hand, that
is, towards the left hand of Israel; but Manasses
on his left hand, to wit, towards his father's right
hand, and brought them near to him.
14But he, stretching forth his right hand,
put it upon the head of Ephraim, the younger
brother; and the left upon the head of Manasses,
who was the elder, changing his hands.
15And Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph, and
said: God, in whose sight my fathers Abraham
and Isaac walked, God that feedeth me from my
youth until this day:
16The angel that delivereth me from all evils,
bless these boys: and let my name be called upon
them, and the names of my fathers Abraham and
Isaac; and may they grow into a multitude upon
the earth.
17And Joseph seeing that his father had put
his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, was
much displeased: and taking his father's hand,
he tried to lift it from Ephraim's head, and to
remove it to the head of Manasses.
18And he said to his father: It should not be
so, my father; for this is the rstborn, put thy
right hand upon his head.
19But he refusing, said: I know, my son, I
know: and this also shall become a people, and
shall be multiplied; but his younger brother shall
be greater than he; and his seed shall grow into
nations.
20And he blessed them at that time, saying:
In thee shall Israel be blessed, and it shall be
said: God do to thee as to Ephraim, and as to
Manasses. And he set Ephraim before Manasses.
21And he said to Joseph, his son: Behold I
die, and God will be with you, and will bring
you back into the land of your fathers.
22I give thee a portion above thy brethren,
which I took out of the hand of the Amorrhite
with my sword and bow.
Chapter 49
And Jacob called his sons, and said to them:
Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you
the things that shall befall you in the last days.
2Gather yourselves together, and hear, O ye
sons of Jacob, hearken to Israel, your father:
3Ruben, my rstborn, thou art my strength,
and the beginning of my sorrow; excelling in
gifts, greater in command.
4Thou art poured out as water, grow thou
not; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed,
and didst dele his couch.
5Simeon and Levi brethren: vessels of iniq-
uity waging war.
6Let not my soul go into their counsel, nor
my glory be in their assembly: because in theirfury they slew a man, and in their selfwill they
undermined a wall.
7Cursed be their fury, because it was stub-
born: and their wrath, because it was cruel: I
will divide them in Jacob, and will scatter them
in Israel.
8Juda, thee shall thy brethren praise: thy
hand shall be on the necks of thy enemies; the
sons of thy father shall bow down to thee.
9Juda is a lion's whelp: to the prey, my son,
thou art gone up: resting thou hast couched as
a lion, and as a lioness, who shall rouse him?
10The sceptre shall not be taken away from
Juda, nor a ruler from his thigh, till he come that
is to be sent, and he shall be the expectation of
nations.
11Tying his foal to the vineyard, and his ass,
O my son, to the vine. He shall wash his robe in
wine, and his garment in the blood of the grape.
12His eyes are more beautiful than wine, and
his teeth whiter than milk.
13Zabulon shall dwell on the seashore, and in
the road of ships, reaching as far as Sidon.
14Issachar shall be a strong ass, lying down
between the borders.
15He saw rest that it was good: and the land
that it was excellent: and he bowed his shoulder
to carry, and became a servant under tribute.
16Dan shall judge his people like another
tribe in Israel.
17Let Dan be a snake in the way, a serpent
in the path, that biteth the horse's heels, that
his rider may fall backward.
18I will look for thy salvation, O Lord.
19Gad, being girded, shall ght before him:
and he himself shall be girded backward.
20Aser, his bread shall be fat, and he shall
yield dainties to kings.
21Nephthali, a hart let loose, and giving
words of beauty.
22Joseph is a growing son, a growing son and
comely to behold: the daughters run to and fro
upon the wall;
23But they that held darts, provoked him,
and quarrelled with him, and envied him.
24His bow rested upon the strong, and the
bands of his arms and his hands were loosed, by
the hands of the mighty one of Jacob: thence he
came forth a pastor, the stone of Israel.
25The God of thy father shall be thy helper,
and the Almighty shall bless thee with the bless-
ings of heaven above, with the blessings of the
deep that lieth beneath, with the blessings of the
breasts and of the womb.
26The blessings of thy father are strength-
ened with the blessings of his fathers: until the
desire of the everlasting hills should come: may
they be upon the head of Joseph, and upon the
crown of the Nazarite among his brethren.
27Benjamin a ravenous wolf, in the morning
shall eat the prey, and in the evening shall divide
the spoil.
28All these are the twelve tribes of Israel:
these things their father spoke to them, and he
blessed every one with their proper blessings.
29And he charged them, saying: I am now
going to be gathered to my people: bury me with
my fathers in the double cave, which is in the
eld of Ephron the Hethite,
30Over against Mambre, in the land of
Chanaan, which Abraham bought together with
the eld, of Ephron the Hethite, for a possession
to bury in.
31There they buried him, and Sara his wife:
there was Isaac buried with Rebecca, his wife:
there also Lia doth lie buried.
32And when he had ended the command-
ments, wherewith he instructed his sons, he drew
up his feet upon the bed, and died: and he was
gathered to his people.Chapter 50
And when Joseph ssaw this, he fell upon his fa-
ther's face, weeping and kissing him.
2And he commanded his servants, the physi-
cians, to embalm his father.
3And while they were fullling his commands,
there passed forty days: for this was the man-
ner with bodies that were embalmed, and Egypt
mourned for him seventy days.
4And the time of the mourning being expired,
Joseph spoke to the family of Pharao: If I have
found favour in your sight, speak in the ears of
Pharao:
5For my father made me swear to him, saying:
Behold I die; thou shalt bury me in my sepulchre
which I have digged for myself in the land of
Chanaan. So I will go up and bury my father,
and return.
6And Pharao said to him: Go up and bury
thy father according as he made thee swear.
7So he went up, and there went with him all
the ancients of Pharao's house, and all the elders
of the land of Egypt.
8And the house of Joseph with his brethren,
except their children, and their 
ocks and herds,
which they left in the land of Gessen.
9He had also in his train chariots and horse-
men: and it was a great company.
10And they came to the threshing 
oor
of Atad, which is situated beyond the Jordan:
where celebrating the exequies with a great and
vehement lamentation, they spent full seven
days.
11And when the inhabitants of Chanaan saw
this, they said: This is a great mourning to the
Egyptians. And therefore the name of that place
was called, The mourning of Egypt.
12So the sons of Jacob did as he had com-
manded them.
13And carrying him into the land of
Chanaan, they buried him in the double cave,
which Abraham had bought together with the
eld for a possession of a burying place, of Eh-
pron, the Hethite, over against Mambre.
14And Joseph returned into Egypt with his
brethren, and all that were in his company, after
he had buried his father.
15Now he being dead, his brethren were
afraid, and talked one with another: Lest per-
haps he should remember the wrong he suered,
and requite us all the evil that we did to him.
16And they sent a message to him, saying:
Thy father commanded us before he died,
17That we should say thus much to thee from
him: I beseech thee to forget the wickedness of
thy brethren, and the sin and malice they prac-
tised against thee: we also pray thee, to forgive
the servants of the God of thy father this wicked-
ness. And when Joseph heard this, he wept.
18And his brethren came to him; and wor-
shipping prostrate on the ground, they said: We
are thy servants.
19And he answered them: Fear not: can we
resist the will of God?
20You thought evil against me: but God
turned it into good, that he might exalt me, as
at present you see, and might save many people.
21Fear not: I will feed you and your children.
And he comforted them, and spoke gently and
mildly.
22And he dwelt in Egypt with all his father's
house; and lived a hundred and ten years. And
he saw the children of Ephraim to the third gen-
eration. The children also of Machir, the sons of
Manasses, were born on Joseph's knees.
23After which he told his brethren: God will
visit you after my death, and will make you go
up out of this land, to the land which he swore
to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.24And he made them swear to him, saying:
God will visit you, carry my bones with you out
of this place:
25And he died, being a hundred and ten years
old. And being embalmed, he was laid in a con
in Egypt.
