And light\\nwas made.\\n4And God saw the light that it was good; and\\nhe divided the light from the darkness.\\n5And he called the light Day, and the dark-\\nness Night; and there was evening and morning\\none day.\\n6And God said: Let there be a \\x0crmament\\nmade amidst the waters: and let it divide the\\nwaters from the waters.\\n7And god made a \\x0crmament, and divided\\nthe waters that were under the \\x0crmament, from\\nthose that were above the \\x0crmament, and it was\\nso.\\n8And God called the \\x0crmament, Heaven; and\\nthe evening and morning were the second day.\\n9God also said; Let the waters that are under\\nthe heaven, be gathered together into one place:\\nand let the dry land appear. And it was so done.\\n10And God called the dry land, Earth; and\\nthe gathering together of the waters, he called\\nSeas. And God saw that it was good.\\n11And he said: let the earth bring forth green\\nherb, and such as may seed, and the fruit tree\\nyielding fruit after its kind, which may have seed\\nin itself upon the earth. And it was so done.12And the earth brought forth the green\\nherb, and such as yieldeth seed according to its\\nkind, and the tree that beareth fruit, having seed\\neach one according to its kind. And God saw\\nthat it was good.\\n13And the evening and the morning were the\\nthird day.\\n14And God said: Let there be lights made\\nin the \\x0crmament of heaven, to divide the day\\nand the night, and let them be for signs, and for\\nseasons, and for days and years:\\n15To shine in the \\x0crmament of heaven, and\\nto give light upon the earth, and it was so done.\\n16And God made two great lights: a greater\\nlight to rule the day; and a lesser light to rule\\nthe night: and The stars.\\n17And he set them in the \\x0crmament of heaven\\nto shine upon the earth.\\n18And to rule the day and the night, and to\\ndivide the light and the darkness. And God saw\\nthat it was good.\\n19And the evening and morning were the\\nfourth day.\\n20God also said: let the waters bring forth\\nthe creeping creature having life, and the fowl\\nthat may \\ry over the earth under the \\x0crmament\\nof heaven.\\n21And God created the great whales, and\\nevery living and moving creature, which the\\nwaaters brought forth, according to their kinds,\\nand every winged fowl according to its kind. And\\nGod saw that it was good.\\n22And he blessed them, saying: Increase and\\nmultiply, and \\x0cll the waters of the sea: and let\\nthe birds be multiplied upon the earth.\\n23And the evening and morning were the \\x0cfth\\nday.\\n24And God said: Let the earth bring forth\\nthe living creature in its kind, cattle and creeping\\nthings, and beasts of the earth, according to their\\nkinds. And it was so done.\\n25And God made the beasts of the earth\\naccording to their kinds, and cattle, and every\\nthing that creepeth on the earth after its kind.\\nAnd God saw that it was good.\\n26And he said: Let us make man to our image\\nand likeness: and let him have dominion over the\\n\\x0cshes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the\\nbeasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping\\ncreature that moveth upon the earth.\\n27And God created man to his own image:\\nto the image of God he created him: male and\\nfemale he created them.\\n28And God blessed them, saying: Increase\\nand multiply, and \\x0cll the earth, and subdue it,\\nand rule over the \\x0cshes of the sea, and the fowls\\nof the air, and all living creatures that move\\nupon the earth.\\n29And God said: Behold I have given you\\nevery herb bearing seed upon the earth, and all\\ntrees that have in themselves seed of their own\\nkind, to be your meat:\\n30And to all beasts of the earth, and to every\\nfowl of the air, and to all that move upon the\\nearth, and wherein there is life, that they may\\nhave to feed upon. And it was so done.\\n31And God saw all the things that he had\\nmade, and they were very good. And the evening\\nand morning were the sixth day.Chapter 2\\nSo the heavens and the earth were \\x0cnished, and\\nall the furniture of them.\\n2And on the seventh day God ended his work\\nwhich he had made: and he rested on the seventh\\nday from all his work which he had done.\\n3And he blessed the seventh day, and sancti-\\n\\x0ced it: because in it he had rested from all his\\nwork which God created and made.\\n4These are the generations of the heaven and\\nthe earth, when they were created, in the day\\nthat the Lord God made the heaven and the\\nearth:\\n5And every plant of the \\x0celd before it sprung\\nup in the earth, and every herb of the ground\\nbefore it grew: for the Lord God had not rained\\nupon the earth; and there was not a man to till\\nthe earth.\\n6But a spring rose out of the earth, watering\\nall the surface of the earth.\\n7And the Lord God formed man of the slime\\nof the earth: and breathed into his face the\\nbreath of life, and man became a living soul.\\n8And the Lord God had planted a paradise of\\npleasure from the beginning: wherein he placed\\nman whom he had formed.\\n9And the Lord God brought forth of the\\nground all manner of trees, fair to behold, and\\npleasant to eat of: the tree of life also in the\\nmidst of paradise: and the tree of knowledge of\\ngood and evil.\\n10And a river went out of the place of plea-\\nsure to water paradise, which from thence is di-\\nvided into four heads.\\n11The name of the one is Phison: that is it\\nwhich compasseth all the land of Hevilath, where\\ngold groweth.\\n12And the gold of that land is very good:\\nthere is found bdellium, and the onyx stone.\\n13And the name of the second river is Gehon:\\nthe same is it that compasseth all the land of\\nEthiopia.\\n14And the name of the third river is Tigris:\\nthe same passeth along by the Assyrians. And\\nthe fourth river is Euphrates.\\n15And the Lord God took man, and put him\\ninto the paradise of pleasure, to dress it, and to\\nkeep it.\\n16And he commanded him, saying: Of every\\ntree of paradise thou shalt eat:\\n17But of the tree of knowledge of good and\\nevil, thou shalt not eat. For in what day soever\\nthou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.\\n18And the Lord God said: It is not good for\\nman to be alone: let us make him a help like\\nunto himself.\\n19And the Lord God having formed out of\\nthe ground all the beasts of the earth, and all\\nthe fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to see\\nwhat he would call them: for whatsoever Adam\\ncalled any living creature the same is its name.\\n20And Adam called all the beasts by their\\nnames, and all the fowls of the air, and all the\\ncattle of the \\x0celd: but for Adam there was not\\nfound a helper like himself.\\n21Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon\\nAdam: and when he was fast asleep, he took one\\nof his ribs, and \\x0clled up \\resh for it.\\n22And the Lord God built the rib which he\\ntook from Adam into a woman: and brought her\\nto Adam.\\n23And Adam said: This now is bone of my\\nbones, and \\resh of my \\resh; she shall be called\\nwoman, because she was taken out of man.\\n24Wherefore a man shall leave father and\\nmother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they\\nshall be two in one \\resh.\\n25And they were both naked: to wit, Adam\\nand his wife: and were not ashamed.Chapter 3\\nNow the serpent was more subtle tha any of the\\nbeasts of the earth which the Lord God had\\nmade. And he said to the woman: Why hath\\nGod commanded you, that you should not eat\\nof every tree of paradise?\\n2And the woman answered him, saying: Of\\nthe fruit of the trees that are in paradise we do\\neat:\\n3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the\\nmidst of paradise, God hath commanded us that\\nwe should not eat; and that we should not touch\\nit, lest perhaps we die.\\n4And the serpent said to the woman: No, you\\nshall not die the death.\\n5For God doth know that in what day soever\\nyou shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened:\\nand you shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.\\n6And the woman saw that the tree was good\\nto eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to\\nbehold: and she took of the fruit thereof, and\\ndid eat, and gave to her husband, who did eat.\\n7And the eyes of them both were opened:\\nand when they perceived themselves to be naked,\\nthey sewed together \\x0cg leaves, and made them-\\nselves aprons.\\n8And when they heard the voice of the Lord\\nGod walking in paradise at the afternoon air,\\nAdam and his wife hid themselves from the face\\nof the Lord God, amidst the trees of paradise.\\n9And the Lord God called Adam, and said to\\nhim: Where art thou?\\n10And he said: I heard thy voice in paradise;\\nand I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid\\nmyself.\\n11And he said to him: And who hath told\\nthee that thou wast naked, but that thou hast\\neaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that\\nthou shouldst not eat?\\n12And Adam said: The woman, whom thou\\ngavest me to be my companion, gave me of the\\ntree, and I did eat.\\n13And the Lord God said to the woman: Why\\nhast thou done this? And she answered: The\\nserpent deceived me, and I did eat.\\n14And the Lord God said to the serpent: Be-\\ncause thou hast done this thing, thou art cursed\\namong all cattle, and beasts of the earth: upon\\nthy breast shalt thou go, and earth shalt thou\\neat all the days of thy life.\\n15I will put enmities between thee and the\\nwoman, and thy seed and her seed: she shall\\ncursh thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her\\nheel.\\n16To the woman also he said: I will multi-\\nply thy sorrows, and thy conceptions: in sorrow\\nshalt thou bring forth children, and thou shalt\\nbe under thy husband's power, and he shall have\\ndominion over thee.\\n17And to Adam he said: Because thou hast\\nhearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten\\nof the tree, whereof I commanded thee, that thou\\nshouldst not eat, cursed is the earth in thy work:\\nwith labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the\\ndays of thy life.\\n18Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to\\nthee, and thou shalt eat the herbs of the earth.\\n19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread\\ntill thou return to the earth out of which thou\\nwast taken: for dust thou art, and into dust thou\\nshalt return.\\n20And Adam called the name of his wife Eve:\\nbecause she was the mother of all the living.\\n21And the Lord God made for Adam and his\\nwife garments of skins, and clothed them.\\n22And he said: Behold Adam is become as\\none of us, knowing good and evil: now therefore\\nlest perhaps he put forth his hand and take also\\nof the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.23And the Lord God sent him out of the par-\\nadise of pleasure, to till the earth from which he\\nwas taken.\\n24And he cast out Adam: and placed before\\nthe paradise of pleasure Cherubims, and a \\ram-\\ning sword, turning every way, to keep the way of\\nthe tree of life.\\nChapter 4\\nAnd Adam knew Eve his wife; who conceived\\nand brought forth Cain, saying: I have gotten a\\nman through God.\\n2And again she brought forth his brother\\nAbel. And Abel was a shepherd, and Cain a\\nhusbandman.\\n3And it came to pass after many days, that\\nCain o\\x0bered, of the fruits of the earth, gifts to\\nthe Lord.\\n4Abel also o\\x0bered of the \\x0crstlings of his \\rock,\\nand of their fat: and the Lord had respect to\\nAbel, and to his o\\x0berings.\\n5But to Cain and his o\\x0berings he had no re-\\nspect: and Cain was exceeding angry, and his\\ncountenance fell.\\n6And the Lord said to him: Why art thou\\nangry? and why is thy countenance fallen?\\n7If thou do well, shalt thou not receive? but\\nif ill, shall not sin forthwith be present at the\\ndoor? but the lust thereof shall be under thee,\\nand thou shalt have dominion over it.\\n8And Cain said to Abel his brother: Let us go\\nforth abroad. And when they were in the \\x0celd,\\nCain rose up against his brother Abel, and slew\\nhim.\\n9And the Lord said to Cain: Where is thy\\nbrother Abel? And he answered: I know not:\\nam I my brother's keeper?\\n10And he said to him: What hast thou done?\\nthe voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from\\nthe earth.\\n11Now therefore cursed shalt thou be upon\\nthe earth, which hath opened her mouth and re-\\ncieved the blood of thy brother at thy hand.\\n12When thou shalt till it, it shall not yield\\nto thee its fruit: a fugitive and a vagabond shalt\\nthou be upon the earth.\\n13And Cain said to the Lord: My iniquity is\\ngreater than that I may deserve pardon.\\n14Behold thou dost cast me out this day from\\nthe face of the earth, and from thy face I shall be\\nhid, and I shall be a vagabond and a fugitive on\\nthe earth: every one therefore that \\x0cndeth me,\\nshall kill me.\\n15And the Lord said to him: No, it shall\\nnot so be: but whosoever shall kill Cain, shall\\nbe punished sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark\\nupon Cain, that whosoever found him should not\\nkill him.\\n16And Cain went out from the face of the\\nLord, and dwelt as a fugitive on the earth at the\\neast side of Eden.\\n17And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived,\\nand brought forth Henoch: and he built a city,\\nand called the name thereof by the name of his\\nson Henoch.\\n18And Henoch begot Irad, and Irad be-\\ngot Maviael, and Maviael begot Mathusael, and\\nMathusael begot Lamech,\\n19Who took two wives: the name of the one\\nwas Ada, and the name of the other Sella.\\n20And Ada brought forth Jabel: who was the\\nfather of such as dwell in tents, and of herdsmen.\\n21And his brother's name was Jubal: he was\\nthe father of them that play upon the harp and\\nthe organs.\\n22Sella also brought forth Tubalcain, who\\nwas a hammerer and arti\\x0ccer in every work ofbrass and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was\\nNoema.\\n23And Lamech said to his wives Ada and\\nSella: Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hear-\\nken to my speech: for I have slain a man to the\\nwounding of myself, and a stripling to my own\\nbruising.\\n24Sevenfold vengeance shall be taken for\\nCain: but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold.\\n25Adam also knew his wife again: and she\\nbrought forth a son, and called his name Seth,\\nsaying: God hath given me another seed for\\nAbel, whom Cain slew.\\n26But to Seth also was born a son, whom\\nhe called Enos: this man began to call upon the\\nname of the Lord.\\nChapter 5\\nThis is the book of the generation of Adam.

Noe therefore understood that the\\nwaters were ceased upon the earth.\\n12And he stayed yet other seven days: and\\nhe sent forth the dove, which returned not any\\nmore unto him.\\n13Therefore in the six hundredth and \\x0crst\\nyear, the \\x0crst month, the \\x0crst day of the month,\\nthe waters were lessened upon the earth, and\\nNoe opening the covering of the ark, looked, and\\nsaw that the face of the earth was dried.\\n14In the second month, the seven and twen-\\ntieth day of the month, the earth was dried.\\n15And God spoke to Noe, saying:\\n16Go out of the ark, thou and thy wife, thy\\nsons and the wives of thy sons with thee.\\n17All living things that are with thee of all\\n\\resh, as well in fowls as in beasts, and all creep-\\ning things that creep upon the earth, bring out\\nwith thee, and go ye upon the earth: increase\\nand multiply upon it.\\n18So Noe went out, he and his sons: his wife,\\nand the wives of his sons with him.\\n19And all living things, and cattle, and creep-\\ning things that creep upon the earth, according\\nto their kinds went out of the ark.20And Noe built an altar unto the Lord: and\\ntaking of all cattle and fowls that were clean,\\no\\x0bered holocausts upon the altar.\\n21And the Lord smelled a sweet savour, and\\nsaid: I will no more curse the earth for the sake of\\nman: for the imagination and thought of man's\\nheart are prone to evil from his youth: therefore\\nI will no more destroy every living soul as I have\\ndone.\\n22All the days of the earth, seedtime and har-\\nvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, night\\nand day, shall not cease.\\nChapter 9\\nAnd God blessed Noe and his sons.

And\\nAran begot Lot.\\n28And Aran died before Thare his father, in\\nthe land of his nativity in Ur of the Chaldees.\\n29And Abram and Nachor married wives: the\\nname of Abram's wife was Sarai: and the name\\nof Nachor's wife, Melcha, the daughter of Aran,\\nfather of Melcha and father of Jescha.\\n30And Sarai was barren, and had no children.\\n31And Thare took Abram his son, and Lot\\nthe son of Aran, his son's son, and Sarai his\\ndaughter in law, the wife of Abram his son, and\\nbrought them out of Ur of the Chaldees, to go\\ninto the land of Chanaan: and they came as far\\nas Haran, and dwelt there.\\n32And the days of Thare were two hundred\\nand \\x0cve years, and he died in Haran.\\nChapter 12\\nAnd the Lord said to Abram: Go forth out of\\nthy country, and from thy kindred, and out of\\nthy father's house, and come into the land which\\nI shall shew thee.\\n2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I\\nwill bless thee, and magnify thy name, and thou\\nshalt be blessed.\\n3I will bless them that bless thee, and curse\\nthem that curse thee, and IN THEE shall all the\\nkindreds of the earth be blessed.\\n4So Abram went out as the Lord had com-\\nmanded him, and Lot went with him: Abram\\nwas seventy-\\x0cve years old when he went forth\\nfrom Haran.\\n5And he took Sarai his wife, and Lot his\\nbrother's son, and all the substance which they\\nhad gathered, and the souls which they had got-\\nten in Haran: and they went out to go into the\\nland of Chanaan. And when they were come into\\nit,\\n6Abram passed through the country unto the\\nplace of Sichem, as far as the noble vale: now\\nthe Chanaanite was at that time in the land.\\n7And the Lord appeared to Abram, and said\\nto him: To thy seed will I give this land. And\\nhe built there an altar to the Lord, who had ap-\\npeared to him.\\n8And passing on from thence to a mountain,\\nthat was on the east side of Bethel, he there\\npitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and\\nHai on the east: he built there also an altar to\\nthe Lord, and called upon his name.\\n9And Abram went forward, going and pro-\\nceeding on to the south.\\n10And there came a famine in the country:\\nand Abram went down into Egypt, to sojourn\\nthere: for the famine was very grievous in the\\nland.11And when he was near to enter into Egypt,\\nhe said to Sarai his wife: I know that thou art a\\nbeautiful woman:\\n12And that when the Egyptians shall see\\nthee, they will say: She is his wife: and they\\nwill kill me, and keep thee.\\n13Say, therefore, I pray thee, that thou art\\nmy sister: that I may be well used for thee, and\\nthat my soul may live for thy sake.\\n14And when Abram was come into Egypt,\\nthe Egyptians saw the woman that she was very\\nbeautiful.\\n15And the princes told Pharao, and praised\\nher before him: and the woman was taken into\\nthe house of Pharao.\\n16And they used Abram well for her sake.\\nAnd he had sheep and oxen and he asses, and\\nmen servants, and maid servants, and she asses,\\nand camels.\\n17But the Lord scourged Pharao and his\\nhouse with most grievous stripes for Sarai,\\nAbram's wife.\\n18And Pharao called Abram, and said to him:\\nWhat is this that thou hast done to me? Why\\ndidst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?\\n19For what cause didst thou say, she was thy\\nsister, that I might take her to my wife? Now\\ntherefore there is thy wife, take her, and go thy\\nway.\\n20And Pharao gave his men orders concern-\\ning Abram: and they led him away and his wife,\\nand all that he had.\\nChapter 13\\nAnd Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his\\nwife, and all that he had, and Lot with him into\\nthe south.\\n2And he was very rich in possession of gold\\nand silver.\\n3And he returned by the way, that he came,\\nfrom the south to Bethel, to the place where be-\\nfore he had pitched his tent between Bethel and\\nHai,\\n4In the place of the altar which he had made\\nbefore, and there he called upon the name of the\\nLord.\\n5But Lot also, who was with Abram, had\\n\\rocks of sheep, and herds of beasts, and tents.\\n6Neither was the land able to bear them, that\\nthey might dwell together: for their substance\\nwas great, and they could not dwell together.\\n7Whereupon also there arose a strife between\\nthe herdsmen of Abram and of Lot. And at that\\ntime the Chanaanite and the Pherezite dwelled\\nin that country.\\n8Abram therefore said to Lot: Let there be\\nno quarrel, I beseech thee, between me and thee,\\nand between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen:\\nfor we are brethren.\\n9Behold the whole land is before thee: depart\\nfrom me, I pray thee: if thou wilt go to the left\\nhand, I will take the right: if thou choose the\\nright hand, I will pass to the left.\\n10And Lot lifting up his eyes, saw all the\\ncountry about the Jordan, which was watered\\nthroughout, before the Lord destroyed Sodom\\nand Gomorrha, as the paradise of the Lord, and\\nlike Egypt as one comes to Segor.\\n11And Lot chose to himself the country about\\nthe Jordan, and he departed from the east: and\\nthey were separated one brother from the other.\\n12Abram dwelt in the land of Chanaan: and\\nLot abode in the towns, that were about the Jor-\\ndan, and dwelt in Sodom.\\n13And the men of Sodom were very wicked,\\nand sinners before the face of the Lord beyond\\nmeasure.14And the Lord said to Abram, after Lot\\nwas separated from him: Lift up thy eyes, and\\nlook from the place wherein thou now art, to the\\nnorth and to the south, to the east and to the\\nwest.\\n15All the land which thou seest, I will give to\\nthee, and to thy seed for ever.\\n16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the\\nearth: if any man be able to number the dust of\\nthe earth, he shall be able to number thy seed\\nalso.\\n17Arise and walk through the land in the\\nlength, and the breadth thereof: for I will give it\\nto thee.\\n18So Abram removing his tent, came, and\\ndwelt by the vale of Mambre, which is in Hebron:\\nand he built there an altar to the Lord.\\nChapter 14\\nAnd it came to pass at that time, that Amraphel,\\nking of Sennaar, and Arioch, king of Pontus,\\nand Chodorlahomor, king of the Elamites, and\\nThadal, king of nations,\\n2Made war against Bara, king of Sodom, and\\nagainst Bersa, king of Gomorrha, and against\\nSennaab, king of Adama, and against Semeber,\\nking of Seboim, and against the king of Bala,\\nwhich is Segor.\\n3All these came together into the woodland\\nvale, which now is the salt sea.\\n4For they had served Chodorlahomor twelve\\nyears, and in the thirteenth year they revolted\\nfrom him.\\n5And in the fourteenth year came Chodorla-\\nhomor, and the kings that were with him: and\\nthey smote the Raphaim in Astarothcarnaim,\\nand the Zuzim with them, and the Emim in Save\\nof Cariathaim.\\n6And the Chorreans in the mountains of Seir,\\neven to the plains of Pharan, which is in the\\nwilderness.\\n7And they returned, and came to the foun-\\ntain of Misphat, the same is Cades: and they\\nsmote all the country of the Amalecites, and the\\nAmorrhean that dwelt in Asasonthamar.\\n8And the king of Sodom, and the king of Go-\\nmorrha, and the king of Adama, and the king\\nof Seboim, and the king of Bala, which is Segor,\\nwent out: and they set themselves against them\\nin battle array, in the woodland vale:\\n9To wit, against Chodorlahomor king of the\\nElamites, and Thadal king of nations, and Am-\\nraphel king of Sennaar, and Arioch king of Pon-\\ntus: four kings against \\x0cve.\\n10Now the woodland vale had many pits of\\nslime. And the king of Sodom, and the king\\nof Gomorrha turned their backs, and were over-\\nthrown there: and they that remained, \\red to\\nthe mountain.\\n11And they took all the substance of the\\nSodomites, and Gomorrhites, and all their vict-\\nuals, and went their way:\\n12And Lot also, the son of Abram's brother,\\nwho dwelt in Sodom, and his substance.\\n13And behold one, that had escaped, told\\nAbram the Hebrew, who dwelt in the vale of\\nMambre the Amorrhite, the brother of Escol,\\nand the brother of Aner: for these had made\\na league with Abram.\\n14Which when Abram had heard, to wit, that\\nhis brother Lot was taken, he numbered of the\\nservants born in his house, three hundred and\\neighteen, well appointed: and pursued them to\\nDan.\\n15And dividing his company, he rushed upon\\nthem in the night, and defeated them: and pur-\\nsued them as far as Hoba, which is on the left\\nhand of Damascus.16And he brought back all the substance, and\\nLot his brother, with his substance, the women\\nalso, and the people.\\n17And the king of Sodom went out to meet\\nhim, after he returned from the slaughter of\\nChodorlahomor, and of the kings that were with\\nhim in the vale of Save, which is the king's vale.\\n18But Melchisedech, the king of Salem, bring-\\ning forth bread and wine, for he was the priest\\nof the most high God,\\n19Blessed him, and said: Blessed be Abram\\nby the most high God, who created heaven and\\nearth.\\n20And blessed be the most high God, by\\nwhose protection, the enemies are in thy hands.\\nAnd he gave him the tithes of all.\\n21And the king of Sodom said to Abram:\\nGive me the persons, and the rest take to thyself.\\n22And he answered him: I lift up my hand\\nto the Lord God the most high, the possessor of\\nheaven and earth,\\n23That from the very woofthread unto the\\nshoe latchet, I will not take of any things that\\nare thine, lest thou say: I have enriched Abram.\\n24Except such things as the young men have\\neaten, and the shares of the men that came with\\nme, Aner, Escol, and Mambre: these shall take\\ntheir shares.\\nChapter 15\\nNow when these things were done, the word of\\nthe Lord came to Abram by a vision, saying:\\nFear not, Abram, I am thy protector, and thy\\nreward exceeding great.\\n2And Abram said: Lord God, what wilt thou\\ngive me? I shall go without children: and the\\nson of the steward of my house is this Damascus\\nEliezer.\\n3And Abram added: But to me thou hast not\\ngiven seed: and lo my servant born in my house,\\nshall be my heir.\\n4And immediately the word of the Lord came\\nto him, saying : He shall not be thy heir: but\\nhe that shall come out of thy bowels, him shalt\\nthou have for thy heir.\\n5And he brought him forth abroad, and said\\nto him: Look up to heaven and number the stars\\nif thou canst. And he said to him: So shall thy\\nseed be.\\n6Abram believed God, and it was reputed to\\nhim unto justice.\\n7And he said to him: I am the Lord who\\nbrought thee out from Ur of the Chaldees, to give\\nthee this land, and that thou mightest possess it.\\n8But he said: Lord God, whereby may I know\\nthat I shall possess it?\\n9And the Lord answered, and said: Take me\\na cow of three years old, and a she goat of three\\nyears. and a ram of three years, a turtle also,\\nand a pigeon.\\n10And he took all these, and divided them\\nin the midst, and laid the two pieces of each one\\nagainst the other: but the birds he divided not.\\n11And the fowls came down upon the car-\\ncasses, and Abram drove them away.\\n12And when the sun was setting, a deep sleep\\nfell upon Abram, and a great and darksome hor-\\nror seized upon him.\\n13And it was said unto him: Know thou be-\\nforehand that thy seed shall be a stranger in a\\nland not their own, and they shall bring them\\nunder bondage, and a\\x0fict them four hundred\\nyears.\\n14But I will judge the nation which they shall\\nserve, and after this they shall come out with\\ngreat substance.\\n15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace,\\nand be buried in a good old age.16But in the fourth generation they shall re-\\nturn hither: for as yet the iniquities of the Amor-\\nrhites are not at the full until this present time.\\n17And when the sun was set, there arose a\\ndark mist, and there appeared a smoking fur-\\nnace, and a lamp of \\x0cre passing between those\\ndivisions.\\n18That day God made a covenant with\\nAbram, saying: To thy seed will I give this land,\\nfrom the river to Egypt even to the great river\\nEuphrates.\\n19The Cineans, and Cenezites, the Ced-\\nmonites,\\n20And the Hethites, and the Pherezites, the\\nRaphaim also,\\n21And the Amorrhites, and the Chanaanites,\\nand the Gergesites, and the Jebusites.\\nChapter 16\\nNow Sarai, the wife of Abram, had brought forth\\nno children: but having a handmaid, an Egyp-\\ntian, named Agar,\\n2She said to her husband: Behold, the Lord\\nhath restrained me from bearing: go in unto my\\nhandmaid, it may be I may have children of her\\nat least. And when he agreed to her request,\\n3She took Agar the Egyptian her handmaid,\\nten years after they \\x0crst dwelt in the land of\\nChanaan, and gave her to her husband to wife.\\n4And he went in to her. But she perceiving\\nthat she was with child, despised her mistress.\\n5And Sarai said to Abram: Thou dost un-\\njustly with me: I gave my handmaid into thy bo-\\nsom, and she perceiving herself to be with child,\\ndespiseth me. The Lord judge between me and\\nthee.\\n6And Abram made answer, and said to her:\\nBehold thy handmaid is in thy own hand, use\\nher as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai a\\x0ficted\\nher, she ran away.\\n7And the angel of the Lord having found her,\\nby a fountain of water in the wilderness, which\\nis in the way to Sur in the desert,\\n8He said to her: Agar, handmaid of Sarai,\\nwhence comest thou? and whither goest thou?\\nAnd she answered: I \\ree from the face of Sarai,\\nmy mistress.\\n9And the angel of the Lord said to her: Re-\\nturn to thy mistress, and humble thyself under\\nher hand.\\n10And again he said: I will multiply thy seed\\nexceedingly, and it shall not be numbered for\\nmultitude.\\n11And again: Behold, said he, thou art with\\nchild, and thou shalt bring forth a son: and thou\\nshalt call his name Ismael, because the Lord hath\\nheard thy a\\x0fiction.\\n12He shall be a wild man: his hand will be\\nagainst all men, and all men's hands against him:\\nand he shall pitch his tents over against all his\\nbrethren.\\n13And she called the name of the Lord that\\nspoke unto her: Thou the God who hast seen\\nme. For she said: Verily, here have I seen the\\nhinder parts of him that seeth me.\\n14Therefore she called that well, the well of\\nhim that liveth and seeth me. The same is be-\\ntween Cades and Barad.\\n15And Agar brought forth a son to Abram:\\nwho called his name Ismael.\\n16Abram was four score and six years old\\nwhen Agar brought him forth Ismael.\\nChapter 17\\nAnd after he began to be ninety and nine years\\nold, the Lord appeared to him: and said untohim: I am the Almighty God: walk before me,\\nand be perfect.\\n2And I will make my covenant between me\\nand thee: and I will multiply thee exceedingly.\\n3Abram fell \\rat on his face.\\n4And God said to him: I am, and my\\ncovenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a fa-\\nther of many nations.\\n5Neither shall thy name be called any more\\nAbram: but thou shalt be called Abraham: be-\\ncause I have made thee a father of many nations.\\n6And I will make thee increase exceedingly,\\nand I will make nations of thee, and kings shall\\ncome out of thee.\\n7And I will establish my covenant between\\nme and thee, and between thy seed after thee in\\ntheir generations, by a perpetual covenant: to\\nbe a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee.\\n8And I will give to thee, and to thy seed,\\nthe land of thy sojournment, all the land of\\nChanaan, for a perpetual possession, and I will\\nbe their God.\\n9Again God said to Abraham: And thou\\ntherefore shalt keep my covenant, and thy seed\\nafter thee in their generations.\\n10This is my covenant which you shall ob-\\nserve between me and you, and thy seed after\\nthee: All the male kind of you shall be circum-\\ncised.\\n11And you shall circumcise the \\resh of your\\nforeskin, that it may be for a sign of the covenant\\nbetween me and you.\\n12An infant of eight days old shall be circum-\\ncised among you, every manchild in your genera-\\ntions: he that is born in the house, as well as the\\nbought servant, shall be circumcised, and whoso-\\never is not of your stock:\\n13And my covenant shall be in your \\resh for\\na perpetual covenant.\\n14The male whose \\resh of his foreskin shall\\nnot be circumcised, that soul shall be destroyed\\nout of his people: because he hath broken my\\ncovenant.\\n15God said also to Abraham: Sarai thy wife\\nthou shalt not call Sarai, but Sara.\\n16And I will bless her, and of her I will give\\nthee a son, whom I will bless, and he shall be-\\ncome nations, and kings of people shall spring\\nfrom him.\\n17Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed,\\nsaying in his heart: Shall a son, thinkest thou,\\nbe born to him that is a hundred years old? and\\nshall Sara that is ninety years old bring forth?\\n18And he said to God: O that Ismael may\\nlive before thee.\\n19And God said to Abraham: Sara thy wife\\nshall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his\\nname Isaac, and I will establish my covenant\\nwith him for a perpetual covenant, and with his\\nseed after him.\\n20And as for Ismael I have also heard thee.\\nBehold, I will bless him, and increase, and multi-\\nply him exceedingly: he shall beget twelve chiefs,\\nand I will make him a great nation.\\n21But my covenant I will establish with Isaac,\\nwhom Sara shall bring forth to thee at this time\\nin the next year.\\n22And when he had left o\\x0b speaking with\\nhim, God went up from Abraham.\\n23And Abraham took Ismael his son, and\\nall that were born in his house: and all whom\\nhe had bought, every male among the men of\\nhis house: and he circumcised the \\resh of their\\nforeskin forthwith the very same day, as God had\\ncommanded him.\\n24Abraham was ninety and nine years old,\\nwhen he circumcised the \\resh of his foreskin.\\n25And Ismael his son was full thirteen years\\nold at the time of his circumcision.26The selfsame day was Abraham circum-\\ncised and Ismael his son.\\n27And all the men of his house, as well they\\nthat were born in his house, as the bought ser-\\nvants and strangers, were circumcised with him.\\nChapter 18\\nAnd the Lord appeared to him in the vale of\\nMambre as he was sitting at the door of his tent,\\nin the very heat of the day.\\n2And when he had lifted up his eyes, there\\nappeared to him three men standing near to him:\\nand as soon as he saw them, he ran to meet them\\nfrom the door of his tent, and adored down to\\nthe ground.\\n3And he said: Lord, if I have found favour in\\nthy sight, pass not away from thy servant.\\n4But I will fetch a little water, and wash ye\\nyour feet, and rest ye under the tree.\\n5And I will set a morsel of bread, and\\nstrengthen ye your heart, afterwards you shall\\npass on: for therefore are you come aside to your\\nservant. And they said: Do as thou hast spoken.\\n6Abraham made haste into the tent to Sara,\\nand said to her: Make haste, temper together\\nthree measures of \\rour, and make cakes upon\\nthe hearth.\\n7And he himself ran to the herd, and took\\nfrom thence a calf, very tender and very good,\\nand gave it to a young man, who made haste and\\nboiled it.\\n8He took also butter and milk, and the calf\\nwhich he had boiled, and set before them: but\\nhe stood by them under the tree.\\n9And when they had eaten, they said to him:\\nWhere is Sara thy wife? He answered: Lo she is\\nin the tent.\\n10And he said to him: I will return and come\\nto thee at this time, life accompanying, and Sara,\\nthy wife, shall have a son. Which when Sara\\nheard, she laughed behind the door of the tent.\\n11Now they were both old, and far advanced\\nin years, and it had ceased to be with Sara after\\nthe manner of women.\\n12And she laughed secretly, saying: After I\\nam grown old, and my lord is an old man, shall\\nI give myself to pleasure?\\n13And the Lord said to Abraham: Why did\\nSara laugh, saying: Shall I, who am an old\\nwoman, bear a child indeed?\\n14Is there any thing hard to God? According\\nto appointment I will return to thee at this same\\ntime, life accompanying, and Sara shall have a\\nson.\\n15Sara denied, saying: I did not laugh: for\\nshe was afraid. But the Lord said: Nay; but thou\\ndidst laugh.\\n16And when the men rose up from thence,\\nthey turned their eyes towards Sodom: and\\nAbraham walked with them, bringing them on\\nthe way.\\n17And the Lord said: Can I hide from Abra-\\nham what I am about to do:\\n18Seeing he shall become a great and mighty\\nnation, and in him all the nations of the earth\\nshall be blessed?\\n19For I know that he will command his chil-\\ndren, and his household after him, to keep the\\nway of the Lord, and do judgment and justice:\\nthat for Abraham's sake, the Lord may bring to\\ne\\x0bect all the things he hath spoken unto him.\\n20And the Lord said: The cry of Sodom and\\nGomorrha is multiplied, and their sin is become\\nexceedingly grievous.\\n21I will go down and see whether they have\\ndone according to the cry that is come to me; or\\nwhether it be not so, that I may know.\\n22And they turned themselves from thence,and went their way to Sodom: but Abraham as\\nyet stood before the Lord.\\n23And drawing nigh, he said: Wilt thou de-\\nstroy the just with the wicked?\\n24If there be \\x0cfty just men in the city, shall\\nthey perish withal? and wilt thou not spare that\\nplace for the sake of the \\x0cfty just, if they be\\ntherein?\\n25Far be it from thee to do this thing, and to\\nslay the just with the wicked, and for the just to\\nbe in like case as the wicked; this is not beseem-\\ning thee: thou who judgest all the earth, wilt not\\nmake this judgment.\\n26And the Lord said to him: If I \\x0cnd in\\nSodom \\x0cfty just within the city, I will spare the\\nwhole place for their sake.\\n27And Abraham answered, and said: See-\\ning I have once begun, I will speak to my Lord,\\nwhereas I am dust and ashes.\\n28What if there be \\x0cve less than \\x0cfty just\\npersons? wilt thou for \\x0cve and forty destroy the\\nwhole city: And he said: I will not destroy it, if\\nI \\x0cnd \\x0cve and forty.\\n29And again he said to him: But if forty be\\nfound there, what wilt thou do? He said: I will\\nnot destroy it for the sake of forty.\\n30Lord, saith he, be not angry, I beseech thee,\\nif I speak: What if thirty shall be found there?\\nHe answered: I will not do it, if I \\x0cnd thirty\\nthere.\\n31Seeing, saith he, I have once begun, I will\\nspeak to my Lord: What if twenty be found\\nthere? He said: I will not destroy it for the sake\\nof twenty.\\n32I beseech thee, saith he, be not angry, Lord,\\nif I speak yet once more: What if ten shall be\\nfound there? And he said: I will not destroy it\\nfor the sake of ten.\\n33And the Lord departed, after he had left\\nspeaking to Abraham: and Abraham returned\\nto his place.\\nChapter 19\\nAnd the two angels came to Sodom in the\\nevening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of the\\ncity. And seeing them, he rose up and went\\nto meet them: and worshipped prostrate to the\\nground.\\n2And said: I beseech you, my lords, turn in\\nto the house of your servant, and lodge there:\\nwash your feet, and in the morning you shall go\\non your way. And they said: No, but we will\\nabide in the street.\\n3He pressed them very much to turn in unto\\nhim: and when they were come into his house, he\\nmade them a feast, and baked unleavened bread,\\nand they ate:\\n4But before they went to bed, the men of the\\ncity beset the house, both young and old, all the\\npeople together.\\n5And they called Lot, and said to him: Where\\nare the men that came in to thee at night? bring\\nthem out hither, that we may know them:\\n6Lot went out to them, and shut the door\\nafter him, and said:\\n7Do not so, I beseech you, my brethren, do\\nnot commit this evil.\\n8I have two daughters who, as yet, have not\\nknown man; I will bring them out to you, and\\nabuse you them as it shall please you, so that\\nyou do no evil to these men, because they are\\ncome in under the shadow of my roof.\\n9But they said: Get thee back thither. And\\nagain: Thou camest in, said they, as a stranger,\\nwas it to be a judge? therefore we will a\\x0fict\\nthee more than them. And they pressed very\\nviolently upon Lot: and they were even at the\\npoint of breaking open the doors.10And behold the men put out their hand,\\nand drew in Lot unto them, and shut the door.\\n11And them, that were without, they struck\\nwith blindness from the least to the greatest, so\\nthat they could not \\x0cnd the door.\\n12And they said to Lot: Hast thou here any\\nof thine? son in law, or sons, or daughters, all\\nthat are thine bring them out of this city:\\n13For we will destroy this place, because their\\ncry is grown loud before the Lord, who hath sent\\nus to destroy them.\\n14So Lot went out, and spoke to his sons\\nin law that were to have his daughters, and said:\\nArise: get you out of this place, because the Lord\\nwill destroy this city. And he seemed to them to\\nspeak as it were in jest.\\n15And when it was morning, the angels\\npressed him, saying: Arise, take thy wife, and\\nthe two daughters that thou hast: lest thou also\\nperish in the wickedness of the city.\\n16And as he lingered, they took his hand, and\\nthe hand of his wife, and of his two daughters,\\nbecause the Lord spared him.\\n17And they brought him forth, and set him\\nwithout the city: and there they spoke to him,\\nsaying: Save thy life: look not back, neither stay\\nthou in all the country about: but save thy self\\nin the mountain, lest thou be also consumed.\\n18And Lot said to them: I beseech thee, my\\nLord,\\n19Because thy servant hath found grace be-\\nfore thee, and thou hast magni\\x0ced thy mercy,\\nwhich thou hast shewn to me, in saving my life,\\nand I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some\\nevil seize me, and I die.\\n20There is this city here at hand, to which I\\nmay \\ree, it is a little one, and I shall be saved in\\nit: is it not a little one, and my soul shall live?\\n21And he said to him: Behold also in this, I\\nhave heard thy prayers, not to destroy the city\\nfor which thou hast spoken.\\n22Make haste, and be saved there: because\\nI cannot do any thing till thou go in thither.\\nTherefore the name of that city was called Segor.\\n23The sun was risen upon the earth, and Lot\\nentered into Segor.\\n24And the Lord rained upon Sodom and Go-\\nmorrha brimstone and \\x0cre from the Lord out of\\nheaven.\\n25And he destroyed these cities, and all the\\ncountry about, all the inhabitants of the cities,\\nand all things that spring from the earth.\\n26And his wife looking behind her, was\\nturned into a statue of salt.\\n27And Abraham got up early in the morning,\\nand in the place where he had stood before with\\nthe Lord:\\n28He looked towards Sodom and Gomorrha,\\nand the whole land of that country: and he saw\\nthe ashes rise up from the earth as the smoke of\\na furnace.\\n29Now when God destroyed the cities of that\\ncountry, remembering Abraham, he delivered\\nLot out of the destruction of the cities wherein\\nhe had dwelt.\\n30And Lot went up out of Segor, and abode\\nin the mountain, and his two daughters with him\\n(for he was afraid to stay in Segor) and he dwelt\\nin a cave, he and his two daughters with him.\\n31And the elder said to the younger: Our\\nfather is old, and there is no man left on the\\nearth, to come in unto us after the manner of\\nthe whole earth.\\n32Come, let us make him drunk with wine,\\nand let us lie with him, that we may preserve\\nseed of our father.\\n33And they made their father drink wine that\\nnight: and the elder went in, and lay with her\\nfather: but he perceived not, neither when his\\ndaughter lay down, nor when she rose up.34And the next day the elder said to the\\nyounger: Behold I lay last night with my father,\\nlet us make him drink wine also to night, and\\nthou shalt lie with him, that we may save seed\\nof our father.\\n35They made their father drink wine that\\nnight also, and the younger daughter went in,\\nand lay with him: and neither then did he per-\\nceive when she lay down, nor when she rose up.\\n36So the two daughters of Lot were with child\\nby their father.\\n37And the elder bore a son, and she called\\nhis name Moab: he is the father of the Moabites\\nunto this day.\\n38The younger also bore a son, and she called\\nhis name Ammon; that is, the son of my people:\\nhe is the father of the Ammonites unto this day.\\nChapter 20\\nAbraham removed from thence to the south\\ncountry, and dwelt between Cades and Sur, and\\nsojourned in Gerara.\\n2And he said of Sara his wife: She is my sister.\\nSo Abimelech the king of Gerara sent, and took\\nher.\\n3And God came to Abimelech in a dream by\\nnight, and he said to him: Lo thou shalt die for\\nthe woman that thou hast taken: for she hath a\\nhusband.\\n4Now Abimelech had not touched her, and\\nhe said: Lord, wilt thou slay a nation that is\\nignorant and just?\\n5Did not he say to me: She is my sister: and\\nshe say, He is my brother? in the simplicity of\\nmy heart, and cleanness of my hands have I done\\nthis.\\n6And God said to him: And I know that\\nthou didst it with a sincere heart: and therefore\\nI withheld thee from sinning against me, and I\\nsu\\x0bered thee not to touch her.\\n7Now therefore restore the man his wife, for\\nhe is a prophet: and he shall pray for thee, and\\nthou shalt live: but if thou wilt not restore her,\\nknow that thou shalt surely die, thou and all\\nthat are thine.\\n8And Abimelech forthwith rising up in the\\nnight, called all his servants: and spoke all these\\nwords in their hearing, and all the men were ex-\\nceedingly afraid.\\n9And Abimelech called also for Abraham, and\\nsaid to him: What hast thou done to us? what\\nhave we o\\x0bended thee in, that thou hast brought\\nupon me and upon my kingdom a great sin?\\nthou hast done to us what thou oughtest not\\nto do.\\n10And again he expostulated with him, and\\nsaid: What sawest thou, that thou hast done\\nthis?\\n11Abraham answered: I thought with myself,\\nsaying: Perhaps there is not the fear of God in\\nthis place: and they will kill me for the sake of\\nmy wife:\\n12Howbeit, otherwise also she is truly my\\nsister, the daughter of my father, and not the\\ndaughter of my mother, and I took her to wife.\\n13And after God brought me out of my fa-\\nther's house, I said to her: Thou shalt do me\\nthis kindness: In every place, to which we shall\\ncome, thou shalt say that I am thy brother.\\n14And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and\\nservants and handmaids, and gave to Abraham:\\nand restored to him Sara his wife,\\n15And said: The land is before you, dwell\\nwheresoever it shall please thee.\\n16And to Sara he said: Behold I have given\\nthy brother a thousand pieces of silver, this shall\\nserve thee for a covering of thy eyes to all that\\nare with thee, and whithersoever thou shalt go:and remember thou wast taken.\\n17And when Abraham prayed, God healed\\nAbimelech and his wife, and his handmaids, and\\nthey bore children:\\n18For the Lord had closed up every womb\\nof the house of Abimelech, on account of Sara,\\nAbraham's wife.\\nChapter 21\\nAnd the Lord visited Sara, as he had promised:\\nand ful\\x0clled what he had spoken.\\n2And she conceived and bore a son in her old\\nage, at the time that God had foretold her.\\n3And Abraham called the name of his son,\\nwhom Sara bore him, Isaac.\\n4And he circumcised him the eighth day, as\\nGod had commanded him,\\n5When he was a hundred years old: for at\\nthis age of his father, was Isaac born.\\n6And Sara said: God hath made a laughter\\nfor me: whosoever shall hear of it will laugh with\\nme.\\n7And again she said: Who would believe that\\nAbraham should hear that Sara gave suck to a\\nson, whom she bore to him in his old age?\\n8And the child grew, and was weaned: and\\nAbraham made a great feast on the day of his\\nweaning.\\n9And when Sara had seen the son of Agar,\\nthe Egyptian, playing with Isaac, her son, she\\nsaid to Abraham:\\n10Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for\\nthe son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with\\nmy son Isaac.\\n11Abraham took this grievously for his son.\\n12And God said to him: Let it not seem\\ngrievous to thee for the boy, and for thy bond-\\nwoman: in all that Sara hath said to thee, hear-\\nken to her voice: for in Isaac shall thy seed be\\ncalled.\\n13But I will make the son also of the bond-\\nwoman a great nation, because he is thy seed.\\n14So Abraham rose up in the morning, and\\ntaking bread and a bottle of water, put it upon\\nher shoulder, and delivered the boy, and sent her\\naway. And she departed, and wandered in the\\nwilderness of Bersabee.\\n15And when the water in the bottle was\\nspent, she cast the boy under one of the trees\\nthat were there.\\n16And she went her way, and sat overagainst\\nhim a great way o\\x0b, as far as a bow can carry, for\\nshe said: I will not see the boy die: and sitting\\noveragainst, she lifted up her voice and wept.\\n17And God heard the voice of the boy: and\\nan angel of God called to Agar from heaven, say-\\ning: What art thou doing, Agar? fear not; for\\nGod hath heard the voice of the boy, from the\\nplace wherein he is.\\n18Arise, take up the boy, and hold him by\\nthe hand, for I will make him a great nation.\\n19And God opened her eyes: and she saw a\\nwell of water, and went and \\x0clled the bottle, and\\ngave the boy to drink.\\n20And God was with him: and he grew, and\\ndwelt in the wilderness, and became a young\\nman, an archer.\\n21And he dwelt in the wilderness of Pharan,\\nand his mother took a wife for him out of the\\nland of Egypt.\\n22At the same time Abimelech, and Phicol\\nthe general of his army, said to Abraham: God\\nis with thee in all that thou dost.\\n23Swear therefore by God, that thou wilt not\\nhurt me, nor my posterity, nor my stock: but ac-\\ncording to the kindness that I have done to thee,\\nthou shalt do to me, and to the land wherein\\nthou hast lived a stranger.24And Abraham said: I will swear.\\n25And he reproved Abimelech for a well of\\nwater, which his servants had taken away by\\nforce.\\n26And Abimelech answered: I knew not who\\ndid this thing: and thou didst not tell me, and I\\nheard not of it till today.\\n27Then Abraham took sheep and oxen, and\\ngave them to Abimelech: and both of them made\\na league.\\n28And Abraham set apart seven ewelambs of\\nthe \\rock.\\n29And Abimelech said to him: What mean\\nthese seven ewelambs which thou hast set apart?\\n30But he said: Thou shalt take seven ewe-\\nlambs at my hand: that they may be a testimony\\nfor me, that I dug this well.\\n31Therefore that place was called Bersabee;\\nbecause there both of them did swear.\\n32And they made a league for the well of\\noath.\\n33And Abimelech and Phicol, the general\\nof his army, arose and returned to the land of\\nthe Palestines. But Abraham planted a grove in\\nBersabee, and there called upon the name of the\\nLord God eternal.\\n34And he was a sojourner in the land of the\\nPalestines many days.\\nChapter 22\\nAfter these things, God tempted Abraham, and\\nsaid to him: Abraham, Abraham. And he an-\\nswered: Here I am.\\n2He said to him: Take thy only begotten son\\nIsaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land\\nof vision; and there thou shalt o\\x0ber him for an\\nholocaust upon one of the mountains which I will\\nshew thee.\\n3So Abraham rising up in the night, saddled\\nhis ass, and took with him two young men, and\\nIsaac his son: and when he had cut wood for the\\nholocaust, he went his way to the place which\\nGod had commanded him.\\n4And on the third day, lifting up his eyes, he\\nsaw the place afar o\\x0b.\\n5And he said to his young men: Stay you here\\nwith the ass; I and the boy will go with speed\\nas far as yonder, and after we have worshipped,\\nwill return to you.\\n6And he took the wood for the holocaust, and\\nlaid it upon Isaac his son; and he himself carried\\nin his hands \\x0cre and a sword. And as they two\\nwent on together,\\n7Isaac said to his father: My father. And he\\nanswered: What wilt thou, son? Behold, saith\\nhe, \\x0cre and wood: where is the victim for the\\nholocaust?\\n8And Abraham said: God will provide him-\\nself a victim for an holocaust, my son. So they\\nwent on together.\\n9And they came to the place which God had\\nshewn him, where he built an altar, and laid the\\nwood in order upon it; and when he had bound\\nIsaac his son, he laid him on the altar upon the\\npile of wood.\\n10And he put forth his hand, and took the\\nsword, to sacri\\x0cce his son.\\n11And behold, an angel of the Lord from\\nheaven called to him, saying: Abraham, Abra-\\nham. And he answered: Here I am.\\n12And he said to him: Lay not thy hand upon\\nthe boy, neither do thou any thing to him: now I\\nknow that thou fearest God, and hast not spared\\nthy only begotten son for my sake.\\n13Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw behind\\nhis back a ram, amongst the briers, sticking fast\\nby the horns, which he took and o\\x0bered for a\\nholocaust instead of his son.14And he called the name of that place, The\\nLord seeth. Whereupon, even to this day, it is\\nsaid: In the mountain the Lord will see.\\n15And the angel of the Lord called to Abra-\\nham a second time from heaven, saying:\\n16By my own self have I sworn, saith the\\nLord: because thou hast done this thing, and\\nhast not spared thy only begotten son for my\\nsake:\\n17I will bless thee, and I will multiply thy\\nseed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that\\nis by the sea shore; thy seed shall possess the\\ngates of their enemies.\\n18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the\\nearth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed my\\nvoice.\\n19Abraham returned to his young men, and\\nthey went to Bersabee together, and he dwelt\\nthere.\\n20After these things, it was told Abraham,\\nthat Melcha also had borne children to Nachor\\nhis brother.\\n21Hus, the \\x0crstborn, and Buz, his brother,\\nand Camuel the father of the Syrians,\\n22And Cased, and Azau, and Pheldas, and\\nJedlaph,\\n23And Bathuel, of whom was born Rebecca:\\nthese eight did Melcha bear to Nachor, Abra-\\nham's brother.\\n24And his concubine, named Roma, bore\\nTabee, and Gaham, and Tahas, and Maacha.\\nChapter 23\\nAnd Sara lived a hundred and twenty-seven\\nyears.\\n2And she died in the city of Arbee which is\\nHebron, in the land of Chanaan: and Abraham\\ncame to mourn and weep for her.\\n3And after he rose up from the funeral obse-\\nquies, he spoke to the children of Heth, saying:\\n4I am a stranger and sojourner among you:\\ngive me the right of a burying place with you,\\nthat I may bury my dead.\\n5The children of Heth answered, saying:\\n6My lord, hear us, thou art a prince of God\\namong us: bury thy dead in our principal sepul-\\nchres: and no man shall have power to hinder\\nthee from burying thy dead in his sepulchre.\\n7Abraham rose up, and bowed down to the\\npeople of the land, to wit, the children of Heth:\\n8And said to them: If it please your soul that\\nI should bury my dead, hear me, and intercede\\nfor me to Ephron the son of Seor.\\n9That he may give me the double cave, which\\nhe hath in the end of his \\x0celd: For as much\\nmoney as it is worth he shall give it me before\\nyou, for a possession of a burying place.\\n10Now Ephron dwelt in the midst of the\\nchildren of Heth. And Ephron made answer to\\nAbraham in the hearing of all that went in at\\nthe gate of the city, saying:\\n11Let it not be so, my lord, but do thou\\nrather hearken to what I say: The \\x0celd I de-\\nliver to thee, and the cave that is therein; in the\\npresence of the children of my people, bury thy\\ndead.\\n12Abraham bowed down before the people of\\nthe land.\\n13And he spoke to Ephron, in the presence\\nof the people: I beseech thee to hear me: I will\\ngive money for the \\x0celd; take it, and so will I\\nbury my dead in it.\\n14And Ephron answered:\\n15My lord, hear me. The ground which thou\\ndesirest, is worth four hundred sicles of silver:\\nthis is the price between me and thee: but what\\nis this? bury thy dead.16And when Abraham had heard this, he\\nweighed out the money that Ephron had asked,\\nin the hearing of the children of Heth, four hun-\\ndred sicles of silver, of common current money.\\n17And the \\x0celd that before was Ephron's,\\nwherein was the double cave, looking towards\\nMambre, both it and the cave, and all the trees\\nthereof, in all its limits round about,\\n18Was made sure to Abraham for a posses-\\nsion, in the sight of the children of Heth, and of\\nall that went in at the gate of his city.\\n19And so Abraham buried Sara, his wife, in\\nthe double cave of the \\x0celd, that looked towards\\nMambre, this is Hebron in the land of Chanaan.\\n20And the \\x0celd was made sure to Abraham,\\nand the cave that was in it, for a possession to\\nbury in, by the children of Heth.\\nChapter 24\\nNow Abraham was old, and advanced in age; and\\nthe Lord had blessed him in all things.\\n2And he said to the elder servant of his house,\\nwho was ruler over all he had: Put thy hand\\nunder my thigh,\\n3That I may make thee swear by the Lord, the\\nGod of heaven and earth, that thou take not a\\nwife for my son, of the daughters of the Chanaan-\\nites, among whom I dwell:\\n4But that thou go to my own country and\\nkindred, and take a wife from thence for my son\\nIsaac.\\n5The servant answered: If the woman will not\\ncome with me into this land, must I bring thy son\\nback again to the place from whence thou camest\\nout?\\n6And Abraham said: Beware thou never\\nbring my son back again thither.\\n7The Lord God of heaven, who took me out\\nof my father's house, and out of my native coun-\\ntry, who spoke to me, and swore to me, saying:\\nTo thy seed will I give this land: he will send\\nhis angel before thee, and thou shalt take from\\nthence a wife for my son.\\n8But if the woman will not follow thee, thou\\nshalt not be bound by the oath: only bring not\\nmy son back thither again.\\n9The servant, therefore, put his hand under\\nthe thigh of Abraham, his lord, and swore to him\\nupon his word.\\n10And he took ten camels of his master's\\nherd, and departed, carrying something of all his\\ngoods with him, and he set forward and went on\\nto Mesopotamia, to the city of Nachor.\\n11And when he had made the camels lie down\\nwithout the town, near a well of water, in the\\nevening, at the time when women are wont to\\ncome out to draw water, he said:\\n12O Lord, the God of my master, Abraham,\\nmeet me today, I beseech thee, and shew kind-\\nness to my master, Abraham.\\n13Behold, I stand nigh the spring of water,\\nand the daughters of the inhabitants of this city\\nwill come out to draw water:\\n14Now, therefore, the maid to whom I shall\\nsay: Let down thy pitcher that I may drink:\\nand she shall answer, Drink, and I will give thy\\ncamels drink also: let it be the same whom thou\\nhast provided for thy servant Isaac: and by this,\\nI shall understand that thou hast shewn kindness\\nto my master.\\n15He had not yet ended these words within\\nhimself, and behold Rebecca came out, the\\ndaughter of Bathuel, son of Melcha, wife to Na-\\nchor the brother of Abraham, having a pitcher\\non her shoulder:\\n16An exceeding comely maid, and a most\\nbeautiful virgin, and not known to man: and she\\nwent down to the spring, and \\x0clled her pitcher,and was coming back.\\n17And the servant ran to meet her, and said:\\nGive me a little water to drink of thy pitcher.\\n18And she answered: Drink, my lord. And\\nquickly she let down the pitcher upon her arm,\\nand gave him drink.\\n19And when he had drunk, she said: I will\\ndraw water for thy camels also, till they all drink.\\n20And pouring out the pitcher into the\\ntroughs, she ran back to the well to draw water;\\nand having drawn, she gave to all the camels.\\n21But he musing, beheld her with silence,\\ndesirous to know whether the Lord had made\\nhis journey prosperous or not.\\n22And after that the camels had drunk, the\\nman took out golden earrings, weighing two\\nsicles; and as many bracelets, of ten sicles weight.\\n23And he said to her: Whose daughter art\\nthou? tell me: is there any place in thy father's\\nhouse to lodge?\\n24And she answered: I am the daughter of\\nBathuel, the son of Melcha, whom she bore to\\nNachor.\\n25And she said, moreover, to him: We have\\ngood store of both straw and hay, and a large\\nplace to lodge in.\\n26The man bowed himself down, and adored\\nthe Lord,\\n27Saying: Blessed be the Lord God of my\\nmaster Abraham, who hath not taken away his\\nmercy and truth from my master, and hath\\nbrought me the straight way into the house of\\nmy master's brother.\\n28Then the maid ran, and told in her\\nmother's house all that she had heard.\\n29And Rebecca had a brother, named Laban,\\nwho went out in haste to the man, to the well.\\n30And when he had seen the earrings and\\nbracelets in his sister's hands, and had heard all\\nthat she related, saying, Thus and thus the man\\nspoke to me: he came to the man who stood by\\nthe camels, and near to the spring of water,\\n31And said to him: Come in, thou blessed\\nof the Lord; why standest thou without? I have\\nprepared the house, and a place for the camels.\\n32And he brought him into his lodging; and\\nhe unharnessed the camels, and gave straw and\\nhay, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of\\nthe men that were come with him.\\n33And bread was set before him. But he said:\\nI will not eat, till I tell my message. He answered\\nhim: Speak.\\n34And he said: I am the servant of Abraham:\\n35And the Lord hath blessed my master won-\\nderfully, and he is become great: and he hath\\ngiven him sheep and oxen, silver and gold, men\\nservants and women servants, camels and asses.\\n36And Sara, my master's wife, hath borne my\\nmaster a son in her old age, and he hath given\\nhim all that he had.\\n37And my master made me swear, saying:\\nThou shalt not take a wife for my son of the\\nChanaanites, in whose land I dwell:\\n38But thou shalt go to my father's house, and\\nshalt take a wife of my own kindred for my son:\\n39But I answered my master: What if the\\nwoman will not come with me?\\n40The Lord, said he, in whose sight I walk,\\nwill send his angel with thee, and will direct thy\\nway: and thou shalt take a wife for my son of\\nmy own kindred, and of my father's house.\\n41But thou shalt be clear from my curse,\\nwhen thou shalt come to my kindred, if they will\\nnot give thee one.\\n42And I came today to the well of water,\\nand said: O Lord God of my master, Abraham,\\nif thou hast prospered my way, wherein I now\\nwalk,\\n43Behold, I stand by the well of water, and\\nthe virgin, that shall come out to draw water,who shall hear me say: Give me a little water to\\ndrink of thy pitcher:\\n44And shall say to me: Both drink thou, and\\nI will also draw for thy camels: let the same be\\nthe woman, whom the Lord hath prepared for\\nmy master's son.\\n45And whilst I pondered these things secretly\\nwith myself, Rebecca appeared, coming with a\\npitcher, which she carried on her shoulder: and\\nshe went down to the well and drew water. And\\nI said to her: Give me a little to drink.\\n46And she speedily let down the pitcher from\\nher shoulder, and said to me: Both drink thou,\\nand to thy camels I will give drink. I drank, and\\nshe watered the camels.\\n47And I asked her, and said: Whose daughter\\nart thou? And she answered: I am the daugh-\\nter of Bathuel, the son of Nachor, whom Melcha\\nbore to him. So I put earrings on her to adorn\\nher face, and I put bracelets on her hands.\\n48And falling down, I adored the Lord, bless-\\ning the Lord God of my master, Abraham, who\\nhath brought me the straight way to take the\\ndaughter of my master's brother for his son.\\n49Wherefore, if you do according to mercy\\nand truth with my master, tell me: but if it\\nplease you otherwise, tell me that also, that I\\nmay go to the right hand, or to the left.\\n50And Laban and Bathuel answered: The\\nword hath proceeded from the Lord: we cannot\\nspeak any other thing to thee but his pleasure.\\n51Behold, Rebecca is before thee, take her\\nand go thy way, and let her be the wife of thy\\nmaster's son, as the Lord hath spoken.\\n52Which when Abraham's servant heard,\\nfalling down to the ground, he adored the Lord.\\n53And bringing forth vessels of silver and\\ngold, and garments, he gave them to Rebecca,\\nfor a present. He o\\x0bered gifts also to her broth-\\ners, and to her mother.\\n54And a banquet was made, and they ate\\nand drank together, and lodged there. And in\\nthe morning, the servant arose, and said: Let\\nme depart, that I may go to my master.\\n55And her brother and mother answered: Let\\nthe maid stay, at least, ten days with us, and\\nafterwards she shall depart.\\n56Stay me not, said he, because the Lord\\nhath prospered my way: send me away, that I\\nmay go to my master.\\n57And they said: Let us call the maid, and\\nask her will.\\n58And they called her, and when she was\\ncome, they asked: Wilt thou go with this man?\\nShe said: I will go.\\n59So they sent her away, and her nurse, and\\nAbraham's servant, and his company.\\n60Wishing prosperity to their sister, and say-\\ning: Thou art our sister, mayst thou increase to\\nthousands of thousands; and may thy seed pos-\\nsess the gates of their enemies.\\n61So Rebecca and her maids, being set upon\\ncamels, followed the man: who with speed re-\\nturned to his master.\\n62At the same time, Isaac was walking along\\nthe way to the well which is called Of the living\\nand the seeing: for he dwelt in the south country:\\n63And he was gone forth to meditate in the\\n\\x0celd, the day being now well spent: and when\\nhe had lifted up his eyes, he saw camels coming\\nafar o\\x0b.\\n64Rebecca also, when she saw Isaac, lighted\\no\\x0b the camel,\\n65And said to the servant: Who is that man\\nwho cometh towards us along the \\x0celd? And he\\nsaid to her: That man is my master. But she\\nquickly took her cloak, and covered herself.\\n66And the servant told Isaac all that he had\\ndone.67Who brought her into the tent of Sara his\\nmother, and took her to wife: and he loved her\\nso much, that it moderated the sorrow which was\\noccasioned by his mother's death.\\nChapter 25\\nAnd Abraham married another wife named Ce-\\ntura:\\n2Who bore him Zamram, and Jecsan, and\\nMadan, and Madian, and Jesboc, and Sue.\\n3Jecsan also begot Saba, and Dadan. The\\nchildren of Dadan were Assurim, and Latusim,\\nand Loomim.\\n4But of Madian was born Epha, and Opher,\\nand Henoch, and Abida, and Eldaa: all these\\nwere the children of Cetura.\\n5And Abraham gave all his possessions to\\nIsaac:\\n6And to the children of the concubines he\\ngave gifts, and separated them from Isaac his\\nson, while he yet lived, to the east country.\\n7And the days of Abraham's life were a hun-\\ndred and seventy-\\x0cve years.\\n8And decaying he died in a good old age, and\\nhaving lived a long time, and being full of days:\\nand was gathered to his people.\\n9And Isaac and Ismael his sons buried him\\nin the double cave, which was situated in the\\n\\x0celd of Ephron the son of Seor the Hethite, over\\nagainst Mambre,\\n10Which he had bought of the children of\\nHeth: there was he buried, and Sara his wife.\\n11And after his death, God blessed Isaac his\\nson, who dwelt by the well named Of the living\\nand seeing.\\n12These are the generations of Ismael the son\\nof Abraham, whom Agar the Egyptian, Sara's\\nservant, bore unto him:\\n13And these are the names of his children\\naccording to their calling and generations. The\\n\\x0crstborn of Ismael was Nabajoth, then Cedar,\\nand Adbeel, and Mabsam,\\n14And Masma, and Duma, and Massa,\\n15Hadar, and Thema, and Jethur, and\\nNaphis, and Cedma.\\n16These are the sons of Ismael: and these are\\ntheir names by their castles and towns, twelve\\nprinces of their tribes.\\n17And the years of Ismael's life were a hun-\\ndred and thirty-seven, and decaying he died, and\\nwas gathered unto his people.\\n18And he dwelt from Hevila as far as Sur,\\nwhich looketh towards Egypt, to them that go\\ntowards the Assyrians. He died in the presence\\nof all his brethren.\\n19These also are the generations of Isaac the\\nson of Abraham: Abraham begot Isaac:\\n20Who when he was forty years old, took to\\nwife Rebecca the daughter of Bathuel the Syrian\\nof Mesopotamia, sister to Laban.\\n21And Isaac besought the Lord for his wife,\\nbecause she was barren: and he heard him, and\\nmade Rebecca to conceive.\\n22But the children struggled in her womb,\\nand she said: If it were to be so with me, what\\nneed was there to conceive? And she went to\\nconsult the Lord.\\n23And he answering, said: Two nations are\\nin thy womb, and two peoples shall be divided\\nout of thy womb, and one people shall overcome\\nthe other, and the elder shall serve the younger.\\n24And when her time was come to be deliv-\\nered, behold twins were found in her womb.\\n25He that came forth \\x0crst was red, and hairy\\nlike a skin: and his name was called Esau. Imme-\\ndiately the other coming forth, held his brother's\\nfoot in his hand: and therefore he was called Ja-\\ncob.26Isaac was threescore years old when the\\nchildren were born unto him.\\n27And when they were grown up, Esau be-\\ncame a skilful hunter, and a husbandman: but\\nJacob, a plain man, dwelt in tents.\\n28Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his\\nhunting: and Rebecca loved Jacob.\\n29And Jacob boiled pottage: to whom Esau,\\ncoming faint out of the \\x0celd,\\n30Said: Give me of this red pottage, for I am\\nexceeding faint. For which reason his name was\\ncalled Edom.\\n31And Jacob said to him: Sell me thy \\x0crst\\nbirthright.\\n32He answered: Lo I die, what will the \\x0crst\\nbirthright avail me?\\n33Jacob said: Swear therefore to me. Esau\\nswore to him, and sold his \\x0crst birthright.\\n34And so taking bread and the pottage of\\nlentils, he ate, and drank, and went on his way;\\nmaking little account of having sold his \\x0crst\\nbirthright.\\nChapter 26\\nAnd when a famine came in the land, after that\\nbarrenness which had happened in the days of\\nAbraham, Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the\\nPalestines, to Gerara.\\n2And the Lord appeared to him, and said:\\nGo not down into Egypt, but stay in the land\\nthat I shall tell thee.\\n3And sojourn in it, and I will be with thee,\\nand will bless thee: for to thee and to thy seed\\nI will give all these countries, to ful\\x0cl the oath\\nwhich I swore to Abraham thy father.\\n4And I will multiply thy seed like the stars of\\nheaven: and I will give to thy posterity all these\\ncountries: and in thy seed shall all the nations\\nof the earth be blessed.\\n5Because Abraham obeyed my voice, and\\nkept my precepts and commandments, and ob-\\nserved my ceremonies and laws.\\n6So Isaac abode in Gerara.\\n7And when he was asked by the men of that\\nplace, concerning his wife, he answered: She is\\nmy sister: for he was afraid to confess that she\\nwas his wife, thinking lest perhaps they would\\nkill him because of her beauty.\\n8And when very many days were passed,\\nand he abode there, Abimelech, king of the\\nPalestines, looking out through a window, saw\\nhim playing with Rebecca, his wife.\\n9And calling for him, he said: It is evident\\nshe is thy wife: why didst thou feign her to be\\nthy sister? He answered: I feared lest I should\\ndie for her sake.\\n10And Abimelech said: Why hast thou de-\\nceived us? Some man of the people might have\\nlain with thy wife, and thou hadst brought upon\\nus a great sin. And he commanded all the peo-\\nple, saying:\\n11He that shall touch this man's wife, shall\\nsurely be put to death.\\n12And Isaac sowed in that land, and he found\\nthat same year a hundredfold: and the Lord\\nblessed him.\\n13And the man was enriched, and he went\\non prospering and increasing, till he became ex-\\nceeding great.\\n14And he had possessions of sheep and of\\nherds, and a very great family. Wherefore the\\nPalestines envying him,\\n15Stopped up at that time all the wells, that\\nthe servants of his father, Abraham, had digged,\\n\\x0clling them up with earth:\\n16Insomuch that Abimelech himself said to\\nIsaac: Depart from us, for thou art become much\\nmightier than we.17So he departed, and came to the torrent of\\nGerara, to dwell there:\\n18And he digged again other wells, which the\\nservants of his father, Abraham, had digged, and\\nwhich, after his death, the Philistines had of old\\nstopped up: and he called them by the same\\nnames, by which his father before had called\\nthem.\\n19And they digged in the torrent, and found\\nliving water:\\n20But there also the herdsmen of Gerara\\nstrove against the herdsmen of Isaac, saying: It is\\nour water. Wherefore he called the name of the\\nwell, on occasion of that which had happened,\\nCalumny.\\n21And they digged also another; and for that\\nthey quarrelled likewise, and he called the name\\nof it, Enmity.\\n22Going forward from thence, he digged an-\\nother well, for which they contended not; there-\\nfore he called the name thereof, Latitude, saying:\\nNow hath the Lord given us room, and made us\\nto increase upon the earth.\\n23And he went up from that place to\\nBersabee,\\n24Where the Lord appeared to him that same\\nnight, saying: I am the God of Abraham thy\\nfather, do not fear, for I am with thee: I will\\nbless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant\\nAbraham's sake.\\n25And he built there an altar: and called\\nupon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent;\\nand commanded his servants to dig a well.\\n26To which place when Abimelech, and\\nOchozath his friend, and Phicol chief captain of\\nhis soldiers, came from Gerara,\\n27Isaac said to them: Why are ye come to\\nme, a man whom you hate, and have thrust out\\nfrom you?\\n28And they answered: We saw that the Lord\\nis with thee, and therefore we said: Let there be\\nan oath between us, and let us make a covenant,\\n29That thou do us no harm, as we on our part\\nhave touched nothing of thine, nor have done any\\nthing to hurt thee; but with peace have sent thee\\naway, increased with the blessing of the Lord.\\n30And he made them a feast, and after they\\nhad eaten and drunk:\\n31Arising in the morning, they swore one to\\nanother: and Isaac sent them away peaceably to\\ntheir own home.\\n32And behold, the same day the servants of\\nIsaac came, telling him of a well which they had\\ndigged, and saying: We have found water.\\n33Whereupon he called it Abundance: and\\nthe name of the city was called Bersabee, even\\nto this day.\\n34And Esau being forty years old, married\\nwives, Judith, the daughter of Beeri, the Hethite,\\nand Basemath, the daughter of Elon, of the same\\nplace.\\n35And they both o\\x0bended the mind of Isaac\\nand Rebecca.\\nChapter 27\\nNow Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, and\\nhe could not see: and he called Esau, his elder\\nson, and said to him: My son? And he answered:\\nHere I am.\\n2And his father said to him, Thou seest that\\nI am old, and know not the day of my death.\\n3Take thy arms, thy quiver, and bow, and go\\nabroad; and when thou hast taken something by\\nhunting,\\n4Make me a savoury meat thereof, as thou\\nknowest I like, and bring it that I may eat: and\\nmy soul may bless thee, before I die.\\n5And when Rebecca had heard this, and hewas gone into the \\x0celd to ful\\x0cl his father's com-\\nmandment,\\n6She said to her son Jacob: I heard thy father\\ntalking with Esau, thy brother, and saying to\\nhim:\\n7Bring me of thy hunting, and make me meats\\nthat I may eat, and bless thee in the sight of the\\nLord, before I die.\\n8Now therefore, my son, follow my counsel:\\n9And go thy way to the \\rock, bring me two\\nkids of the best, that I may make of them meat\\nfor thy father, such as he gladly eateth.\\n10Which when thou hast brought in, and he\\nhath eaten, he may bless thee before he die.\\n11And he answered her: Thou knowest that\\nEsau, my brother, is a hairy man, and I am\\nsmooth:\\n12If my father should feel me, and perceive\\nit, I fear lest he will think I would have mocked\\nhim, and I shall bring upon me a curse instead\\nof a blessing.\\n13And his mother said to him: Upon me be\\nthis curse, my son: only hear thou my voice, and\\ngo, fetch me the things which I have said.\\n14He went, and brought, and gave them to\\nhis mother. She dressed meats, such as she knew\\nhis father liked.\\n15And she put on him very good garments of\\nEsau, which she had at home with her:\\n16And the little skins of the kids she put\\nabout his hands, and covered the bare of his\\nneck.\\n17And she gave him the savoury meat, and\\ndelivered him bread that she had baked.\\n18Which when he had carried in, he said: My\\nfather? But he answered: I hear. Who art thou,\\nmy son?\\n19And Jacob said: I am Esau, thy \\x0crstborn:\\nI have done as thou didst command me: arise, sit\\nand eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless\\nme.\\n20And Isaac said to his son: How couldst\\nthou \\x0cnd it so quickly, my son? He answered:\\nIt was the will of God, that what I sought came\\nquickly in my way:\\n21And Isaac said: Come hither, that I may\\nfeel thee, my son, and may prove whether thou\\nbe my son Esau, or no.\\n22He came near to his father, and when he\\nhad felt him, Isaac said: The voice indeed is the\\nvoice of Jacob; but the hands, are the hands of\\nEsau.\\n23And he knew him not, because his hairy\\nhands made him like to the elder. Then blessing\\nhim,\\n24He said: Art thou my son Esau? He an-\\nswered: I am.\\n25Then he said: Bring me the meats of thy\\nhunting, my son, that my soul may bless thee.\\nAnd when they were brought, and he had eaten,\\nhe o\\x0bered him wine also, which after he had\\ndrunk,\\n26He said to him: Come near me, and give\\nme a kiss, my son.\\n27He came near, and kissed him. And im-\\nmediately as he smelled the fragrant smell of\\nhis garments, blessing him, he said: Behold, the\\nsmell of my son is as the smell of a plentiful \\x0celd,\\nwhich the Lord hath blessed.\\n28God give thee of the dew of heaven, and of\\nthe fatness of the earth, abundance of corn and\\nwine.\\n29And let peoples serve thee, and tribes wor-\\nship thee: be thou lord of thy brethren, and\\nlet thy mother's children bow down before thee.\\nCursed be he that curseth thee: and let him that\\nblesseth thee be \\x0clled with blessings.\\n30Isaac had scarce ended his words, when,\\nJacob being now gone out abroad, Esau came,31And brought in to his father meats, made\\nof what he had taken in hunting, saying: Arise,\\nmy father, and eat of thy son's venison; that thy\\nsoul may bless me.\\n32And Isaac said to him: Why! who art\\nthou? He answered: I am thy \\x0crstborn son,\\nEsau.\\n33Isaac was struck with fear, and astonished\\nexceedingly; and wondering beyond what can be\\nbelieved, said: Who is he then that even now\\nbrought me venison that he had taken, and I ate\\nof all before thou camest? and I have blessed\\nhim, and he shall be blessed.\\n34Esau having heard his father's words,\\nroared out with a great cry; and, being in a con-\\nsternation, said: Bless me also, my father.\\n35And he said: Thy brother came deceitfully\\nand got thy blessing.\\n36But he said again: Rightly is his name\\ncalled Jacob; for he hath supplanted me lo this\\nsecond time: My birthright he took away before,\\nand now this second time he hath stolen away\\nmy blessing. And again he said to his father:\\nHast thou not reserved me also a blessing?\\n37Isaac answered: I have appointed him thy\\nlord, and have made all his brethren his servants:\\nI have established him with corn and wine, and\\nafter this, what shall I do more for thee, my son?\\n38And Esau said to him: Hast thou only one\\nblessing, father? I beseech thee bless me also.\\nAnd when he wept with a loud cry,\\n39Isaac being moved, said to him: In the\\nfat of the earth, and in the dew of heaven from\\nabove,\\n40Shall thy blessing be. Thou shalt live by\\nthe sword, and shalt serve thy brother: and the\\ntime shall come, when thou shalt shake o\\x0b and\\nloose his yoke from thy neck.\\n41Esau therefore always hated Jacob, for the\\nblessing wherewith his father had blessed him;\\nand he said in his heart: The days will come of\\nthe mourning for my father, and I will kill my\\nbrother Jacob.\\n42These things were told to Rebecca: and\\nshe sent and called Jacob, her son, and said to\\nhim: Behold Esau, thy brother, threateneth to\\nkill thee.\\n43Now therefore, my son, hear my voice, arise\\nand \\ree to Laban, my brother, to Haran:\\n44And thou shalt dwell with him a few days,\\ntill the wrath of thy brother be assuaged,\\n45And his indignation cease, and he forget\\nthe things thou hast done to him: afterwards\\nI will send, and bring thee from thence hither.\\nWhy shall I be deprived of both my sons in one\\nday?\\n46And Rebecca said to Isaac: I am weary\\nof my life, because of the daughters of Heth: if\\nJacob take a wife of the stock of this land, I\\nchoose not to live.\\nChapter 28\\nAnd Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and\\ncharged him, saying: Take not a wife of the stock\\nof Chanaan:\\n2But go, and take a journey to Mesopotamia\\nof Syria, to the house of Bathuel, thy mother's\\nfather, and take thee a wife thence of the daugh-\\nters of Laban, thy uncle.\\n3And God almighty bless thee, and make thee\\nto increase and multiply thee: that thou mayst\\nbe a multitude of people.\\n4And give the blessings of Araham to thee,\\nand to thy seed after thee: that thou mayst\\npossess the land of thy sojournment, which he\\npromised to thy grandfather.\\n5And when Isaac had sent him away, he took\\nhis journey and went to Mesopotamia of Syria,to Laban, the son of Bathuel, the Syrian, brother\\nto Rebecca, his mother.\\n6And Esau seeing that his father had blessed\\nJacob, and had sent him into Mesopotamia of\\nSyria, to marry a wife thence; and that after the\\nblessing he had charged him, saying: Thou shalt\\nnot take a wife of the daughters of Chanaan:\\n7And that Jacob obeying his parents, was\\ngone into Syria:\\n8Experiencing also, that his father was not\\nwell pleased with the daughters of Chanaan:\\n9He went to Ismael, and took to wife, besides\\nthem he had before, Maheleth, the daughter of\\nIsmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nabajoth.\\n10But Jacob being departed from Bersabee,\\nwent on to Haran.\\n11And when he was come to a certain place,\\nand would rest in it after sunset, he took of\\nthe stones that lay there, and putting under his\\nhead, slept in the same place.\\n12And he saw in his sleep a ladder stand-\\ning upon the earth, and the top thereof touching\\nheaven: the angels also of God ascending and\\ndescending by it.\\n13And the Lord leaning upon the ladder say-\\ning to him: I am the Lord God of Abraham thy\\nfather, and the God of Isaac: The land, wherein\\nthou sleepest, I will give to thee and to thy seed.\\n14And thy seed shall be as the dust of the\\nearth: thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and\\nto the east, and to the north, and to the south:\\nand IN THEE and thy seed, all the tribes of the\\nearth SHALL BE BLESSED.\\n15And I will be thy keeper whithersoever\\nthou goest, and will bring thee back into this\\nland: neither will I leave thee, till I shall have\\naccomplished all that I have said.\\n16And when Jacob awaked out of sleep, he\\nsaid: Indeed the Lord is in this place, and I knew\\nit not.\\n17And trembling, he said: How terrible is this\\nplace? this is no other but the house of God, and\\nthe gate of heaven.\\n18And Jacob arising in the morning, took the\\nstone which he had laid under his head, and set\\nit up for a title, pouring oil upon the top of it.\\n19And he called the name of the city Bethel,\\nwhich before was called Luza.\\n20And he made a vow, saying: If God shall\\nbe with me, and shall keep me in the way, by\\nwhich I walk, and shall give me bread to eat,\\nand raiment to put on,\\n21And I shall return prosperously to my fa-\\nther's house: the Lord shall be my God:\\n22And this stone, which I have set up for a\\ntitle, shall be called the house of God: and of\\nall things that thou shalt give to me, I will o\\x0ber\\ntithes to thee.\\nChapter 29\\nThen Jacob went on in his journey, and came\\ninto the east country.\\n2And he saw a well in the \\x0celd, and three\\n\\rocks of sheep lying by it: for the beasts were\\nwatered out of it, and the mouth thereof was\\nclosed with a great stone.\\n3And the custom was, when all the sheep\\nwere gathered together, to roll away the stone,\\nand after the sheep were watered, to put it on\\nthe mouth of the well again.\\n4And he said to the shepherds: Brethren,\\nwhence are you? They answered: Of Haran.\\n5And he asked them, saying: Know you La-\\nban, the son of Nachor? They said: We know\\nhim.\\n6He said: Is he in health? He is in health, say\\nthey: and behold, Rachel, his daughter, cometh\\nwith his \\rock.7And Jacob said: There is yet much day re-\\nmaining, neither is it time to bring the \\rocks into\\nthe folds again: \\x0crst give the sheep drink, and\\nso lead them back to feed.\\n8They answered: We cannot, till all the cattle\\nbe gathered together, and we remove the stone\\nfrom the well's mouth, that we may water the\\n\\rocks.\\n9They were yet speaking, and behold Rachel\\ncame with her father's sheep; for she fed the\\n\\rock.\\n10And when Jacob saw her, and knew her\\nto be his cousin german, and that they were the\\nsheep of Laban, his uncle: he removed the stone\\nwherewith the well was closed.\\n11And having watered the \\rock, he kissed\\nher: and lifting up his voice wept.\\n12And he told her that he was her father's\\nbrother, and the son of Rebecca: but she went\\nin haste and told her father.\\n13Who, when he heard that Jacob his sister's\\nson was come, ran forth to meet him: and em-\\nbracing him, and heartily kissing him, brought\\nhim into his house. And when he had heard the\\ncauses of his journey,\\n14He answered: Thou art my bone and my\\n\\resh. And after the days of one month were\\nexpired,\\n15He said to him: Because thou art my\\nbrother, shalt thou serve me without wages? Tell\\nme what wages thou wilt have.\\n16Now he had two daughters, the name of\\nthe elder was Lia; and the younger was called\\nRachel.\\n17But Lia was blear eyed: Rachel was well\\nfavoured, and of a beautiful countenance.\\n18And Jacob being in love with her, said:\\nI will serve thee seven years for Rachel, thy\\nyounger daughter.\\n19Laban answered: It is better that I give her\\nto thee than to another man; stay with me.\\n20So Jacob served seven years for Rachel:\\nand they seemed but a few days, because of the\\ngreatness of his love.\\n21And he said to Laban: Give me my wife;\\nfor now the time is ful\\x0clled, that I may go in\\nunto her.\\n22And he, having invited a great number of\\nhis friends to the feast, made the marriage.\\n23And at night he brought in Lia, his daugh-\\nter, to him,\\n24Giving his daughter a handmaid, named\\nZelpha. Now when Jacob had gone in to her\\naccording to custom, when morning was come\\nhe saw it was Lia.\\n25And he said to his father in law: What is\\nit that thou didst mean to do? did not I serve\\nthee for Rachel? why hast thou deceived me?\\n26Laban answered: It is not the custom in\\nthis place, to give the younger in marriage \\x0crst.\\n27Make up the week of days of this match:\\nand I will give thee her also, for the service that\\nthou shalt render me other seven years.\\n28He yielded to his pleasure: and after the\\nweek was past, he married Rachel:\\n29To whom her father gave Bala, for her ser-\\nvant.\\n30And having at length obtained the mar-\\nriage he wished for, he preferred the love of the\\nlatter before the former, and served with him\\nother seven years.\\n31And the Lord seeing that he despised Lia,\\nopened her womb, but her sister remained bar-\\nren.\\n32And she conceived and bore a son, and\\ncalled his name Ruben, saying: The Lord saw\\nmy a\\x0fiction: now my husband will love me.\\n33And again she conceived and bore a son,\\nand said: Because the Lord heard that I wasdespised, he hath given this also to me: and she\\ncalled his name Simeon.\\n34And she conceived the third time, and bore\\nanother son, and said: Now also my husband will\\nbe joined to me, because I have borne him three\\nsons: and therefore she called his name Levi.\\n35The fourth time she conceived and bore a\\nson, and said: Now will I praise the Lord: and for\\nthis she called him Juda. And she left bearing.\\nChapter 30\\nAnd Rachel seeing herself without children, en-\\nvied her sister, and said to her husband: Give\\nme children, otherwise I shall die.\\n2And Jacob being angry with her, answered:\\nAm I as God, who hath deprived thee of the fruit\\nof thy womb?\\n3But she said: I have here my servant Bala:\\ngo in unto her, that she may bear upon my knees,\\nand I may have children by her.\\n4And she gave him Bala in marriage: who,\\n5When her husband had gone in unto her,\\nconceived and bore a son.\\n6And Rachel said: The Lord hath judged for\\nme, and hath heard my voice, giving me a son;\\nand therefore she called his name Dan.\\n7And again Bala conceived, and bore another,\\n8For whom Rachel said: God hath compared\\nme with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she\\ncalled him Nephthali.\\n9Lia perceiving that she had left of bearing,\\ngave Zelpha, her handmaid, to her husband.\\n10And when she had conceived, and brought\\nforth a son,\\n11She said: Happily. And therefore called his\\nname Gad.\\n12Zelpha also bore another.\\n13And Lia said: This is for my happiness: for\\nwomen will call me blessed. Therefore she called\\nhim Aser.\\n14And Ruben going out in the time of the\\nwheat harvest into the \\x0celd, found mandrakes:\\nwhich he brought to his mother Lia. And Rachel\\nsaid: Give me part of thy son's mandrakes.\\n15She answered: Dost thou think it a small\\nmatter, that thou hast taken my husband from\\nme, unless thou take also my son's mandrakes?\\nRachel said: He shall sleep with thee this night,\\nfor thy son's mandrakes.\\n16And when Jacob returned at even from the\\n\\x0celd, Lia went out to meet him, and said: Thou\\nshalt come in unto me, because I have hired thee\\nfor my son's mandrakes. And he slept with her\\nthat night.\\n17And God heard her prayers; and she con-\\nceived: and bore a \\x0cfth son:\\n18And said: God hath given me a reward,\\nbecause I gave my handmaid to my husband.\\nAnd she called his name Issachar.\\n19And Lia conceived again, and bore the\\nsixth son,\\n20And said: God hath endowed me with a\\ngood dowry; this turn also my husband will be\\nwith me, because I have borne him six sons: and\\ntherefore she called his name Zabulon.\\n21After whom she bore a daughter, named\\nDina.\\n22The Lord also remembering Rachel, heard\\nher, and opened her womb.\\n23And she conceived, and bore a son, saying:\\nGod hath taken away my reproach.\\n24And she called his name Joseph: saying:\\nThe Lord give me also another son.\\n25And when Joseph was born, Jacob said to\\nhis father in law: Send me away, that I may\\nreturn into my country, and to my land.26Give me my wives, and my children, for\\nwhom I have served thee, that I may depart:\\nthou knowest the service that I have rendered\\nthee.\\n27Laban said to him: Let me \\x0cnd favour in\\nthy sight: I have learned, by experience, that\\nGod hath blessed me for thy sake.\\n28Appoint thy wages which I shall give thee.\\n29But he answered: Thou knowest how I have\\nserved thee, and how great thy possession hath\\nbeen in my hands.\\n30Thou hadst but little before I came to thee,\\nand now thou art become rich: and the Lord\\nhath blessed thee at my coming. It is reasonable,\\ntherefore, that I should now provide also for my\\nown house.\\n31And Laban said: What shall I give thee?\\nBut he said: I require nothing; but if thou wilt\\ndo what I demand, I will feed and keep thy sheep\\nagain.\\n32Go round through all thy \\rocks, and sepa-\\nrate all the sheep of divers colours, and speckled;\\nand all that is brown and spotted, and of divers\\ncolours, as well among the sheep as among the\\ngoats, shall be my wages.\\n33And my justice shall answer for me tomor-\\nrow before thee, when the time of the bargain\\nshall come; and all that is not of divers colours,\\nand spotted, and brown, as well among the sheep\\nas among the goats, shall accurse me of theft.\\n34And Laban said: I like well what thou de-\\nmandest.\\n35And he separated the same day the she\\ngoats, and the sheep, and the he goats, and the\\nrams of divers colours, and spotted; and all the\\n\\rock of one colour, that is, of white and black\\n\\reece, he deliverdd into the hands of his sons.\\n36And he set the space of three days journey\\nbetwixt himself and his son in law, who fed the\\nrest of his \\rock.\\n37And Jacob took green rods of poplar, and\\nof almond, and of plane trees, and pilled them\\nin part: so when the bark was taken o\\x0b, in the\\nparts that were pilled, there appeared whiteness:\\nbut the parts that were whole, remained green:\\nand by this means the colour was divers.\\n38And he put them in the troughs, where\\nthe water was poured out; that when the \\rocks\\nshould come to drink, they might have the rods\\nbefore their eyes, and in the sight of them might\\nconceive.\\n39And it came to pass, that in the very\\nheat of coition, the sheep beheld the rods, and\\nbrought forth spotted, and of divers colours, and\\nspeckled.\\n40And Jacob separated the \\rock, and put the\\nrods in the troughs before the eyes of the rams;\\nand all the white and the black were Laban's,\\nand the rest were Jacob's, when the \\rocks were\\nseparated one from the other.\\n41So when the ewes went \\x0crst to ram, Ja-\\ncob put the rods in the troughs of water before\\nthe eyes of the rams, and of the ewes, that they\\nmight conceive while they were looking upon\\nthem.\\n42But when the later coming was, and the\\nlast conceiving, he did not put them. And those\\nthat were lateward, became Laban's; and they\\nof the \\x0crst time, Jacob's.\\n43And the man was enriched exceedingly, and\\nhe had many \\rocks, maidservants and menser-\\nvants, camels and asses.\\nChapter 31\\nBut after that he had heard the words of the\\nsons of Laban, saying: Jacob hath taken away\\nall that was our father's, and being enriched by\\nhis substance is become great.2And perceiving also, that Laban's counte-\\nnance was not towards him as yesterday and the\\nother day.\\n3Especially the Lord saying to him: Return\\ninto the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred,\\nand I will be with thee.\\n4He sent, and called Rachel and Lia into the\\n\\x0celd, where he fed the \\rocks,\\n5And said to them: I see your father's coun-\\ntenance is not towards me as yesterday and the\\nother day: but the God of my father hath been\\nwith me.\\n6And you know that I have served your father\\nto the uttermost of my power.\\n7Yea your father hath also overreached me,\\nand hath changed my wages ten times: and yet\\nGod hath not su\\x0bered him to hurt me.\\n8If at any time, he said: The speckled shall be\\nthy wages: all the sheep brought forth speckled:\\nbut when he said on the contrary: Thou shalt\\ntake all the white one for thy wages: all the \\rocks\\nbrought forth white ones.\\n9And God hath taken your father's sub-\\nstance, and given it to me.\\n10For after the time came of the ewes conceiv-\\ning, I lifted up my eyes, and saw in my sleep, that\\nthe males which leaped upon the females were of\\ndivers colours, and spotted, and speckled.\\n11And the angel of God said to me in my\\nsleep: Jacob. And I answered: Here I am.\\n12And he said: Lift up thy eyes, and see that\\nall the males leaping upon the females, are of\\ndivers colours, spotted and speckled. For I have\\nseen all that Laban hath done to thee.\\n13I am the God of Bethel, where thou didst\\nanoint the stone, and make a vow to me. Now\\ntherefore arise, and go out of this land, and re-\\nturn into thy native country.\\n14And Rachel and Lia answered: Have we\\nany thing left among the goods and inheritance\\nof our father's house?\\n15Hath he not counted us as strangers, and\\nsold us, and eaten up the price of us?\\n16But God hath taken our father's riches, and\\ndelivered them to us, and to our children: where-\\nfore, do all that God hath commanded thee.\\n17Then Jacob rose up, and having set his\\nchildren and wives upon camels, went his way.\\n18And he took all his substance, and \\rocks,\\nand whatsoever he had gotten in Mesopotamia,\\nand went forward to Isaac, his father, to the land\\nof Chanaan.\\n19At that time Laban was gone to shear his\\nsheep, and Rachel stole away her father's idols.\\n20And Jacob would not confess to his father\\nin law that he was \\rying away.\\n21And when he was gone, together with all\\nthat belonged to him, and having passed the\\nriver, was going on towards mount Galaad,\\n22It was told Laban on the third day, that\\nJacob \\red.\\n23And he took his brethren with him, and\\npursued after him seven days; and overtook him\\nin the mount of Galaad.\\n24And he saw in a dream God, saying to\\nhim: Take heed thou speak not any thing harshly\\nagainst Jacob.\\n25Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the\\nmountain: and when he, with his brethren, had\\novertaken him, he pitched his tent in the same\\nmount of Galaad.\\n26And he said to Jacob: Why hast thou done\\nthus, to carry away, without my knowledge, my\\ndaughters as captives taken with the sword?\\n27Why wouldst thou run away privately, and\\nnot acquaint me, that I might have brought thee\\non the way with joy, and with songs, and with\\ntimbrels, and with harps?\\n28Thou hast not su\\x0bered me to kiss my sons\\nand daughters; thou hast done foolishly; and nowindeed,\\n29It is in my power to return thee evil; but the\\nGod of your father said to me yesterday: Take\\nheed thou speak not any thing harshly against\\nJacob.\\n30Suppose thou didst desire to go to thy\\nfriends, and hadst a longing after thy father's\\nhouse: why hast thou stolen away my gods?\\n31Jacob answered: That I departed unknown\\nto thee, it was for fear lest thou wouldst take\\naway thy daughters by force.\\n32But, whereas, thou chargest me with theft:\\nwith whomsoever thou shalt \\x0cnd thy gods, let\\nhim be slain before our brethren. Search, and if\\nthou \\x0cnd any of thy things with me, take them\\naway. Now when he said this, he knew not that\\nRachel had stolen the idols.\\n33So Laban went into the tent of Jacob,\\nand of Lia, and of both the handmaids, and\\nfound them not. And when he was entered into\\nRachel's tent,\\n34She, in haste, hid the idols under the\\ncamel's furniture, and sat upon them: and when\\nhe had searched all the tent, and found nothing,\\n35She said: Let not my lord be angry that\\nI cannot rise up before thee, because it has\\nnow happened to me according to the custom\\nof women. So his careful search was in vain.\\n36And Jacob being angry, said in a chiding\\nmanner: For what fault of mine, and for what\\no\\x0bence on my part hast thou so hotly pursued\\nme,\\n37And searched all my household stu\\x0b?\\nWhat hast thou found of all the substance of thy\\nhouse? lay it here before my brethren, and thy\\nbrethren, and let them judge between me and\\nthee.\\n38Have I, therefore, been with thee twenty\\nyears? thy ewes and goats were not barren, the\\nrams of thy \\rocks I did not eat:\\n39Neither did I shew thee that which the\\nbeast had torn; I made good all the damage:\\nwhatsoever was lost by theft, thou didst exact it\\nof me:\\n40Day and night was I parched with heat, and\\nwith frost, and sleep departed from my eyes.\\n41And in this manner have I served thee in\\nthy house twenty years, fourteen for thy daugh-\\nters, and six for thy \\rocks: thou hast changed\\nalso my wages ten times.\\n42Unless the God of my father, Abraham,\\nand the fear of Isaac, had stood by me, peradven-\\nture now thou hadst sent me away naked: God\\nbeheld my a\\x0fiction and the labour of my hands,\\nand rebuked thee yesterday.\\n43Laban answered him: The daughters are\\nmine, and the children, and thy \\rocks, and all\\nthings that thou seest are mine: what can I do\\nto my children, and grandchildren?\\n44Come, therefore, let us enter into a league;\\nthat it may be for a testimony between me and\\nthee.\\n45And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for\\na title.\\n46And he said to his brethren: Bring hither\\nstones. And they, gathering stones together,\\nmade a heap, and they ate upon it.\\n47And Laban called it, The witness heap; and\\nJacob, The hillock of testimony: each of them\\naccording to the propriety of his language.\\n48And Laban said: This heap shall be a wit-\\nness between me and thee this day, and therefore\\nthe name thereof was called Galaad, that is, The\\nwitness heap.\\n49The Lord behold and judge between us,\\nwhen we shall be gone one from the other.\\n50If thou a\\x0fict my daughters, and if thou\\nbring in other wives over them: none is witness\\nof our speech but God, who is present and be-\\nholdeth.51And he said again to Jacob: Behold this\\nheap, and the stone which I have set up between\\nme and thee,\\n52Shall be a witness: this heap, I say, and\\nthe stone, be they for a testimony, if either I\\nshall pass beyond it going towards thee, or thou\\nshalt pass beyond it thinking harm to me.\\n53The God of Abraham, and the God of Na-\\nchor, the God of their father, judge betweeen us.\\nAnd Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac:\\n54And after he had o\\x0bered sacri\\x0cces in the\\nmountain, he called his brethren to eat bread.\\nAnd when they had eaten, they lodged there:\\n55But Laban arose in the night, and kissed\\nhis sons and daughters, and blessed them: and\\nreturned to his place.\\nChapter 32\\nJacob also went on the journey he had begun:\\nand the angels of God met him.\\n2And when he saw them, he said: These are\\nthe camps of God, and he called the name of\\nthat place Mahanaim, that is, Camps.\\n3And he sent messengers before him to Esau,\\nhis brother, to the land of Seir, to the country of\\nEdom:\\n4And he commanded them, saying: Thus\\nshall ye speak to my lord Esau: Thus saith thy\\nbrother Jacob: I have sojourned with Laban, and\\nhave been with him until this day:\\n5I have oxen, and asses, and sheep, and\\nmenservants, and womenservants: and now I\\nsend a message to my lord, that I may \\x0cnd favour\\nin thy sight.\\n6And the messengers returned to Jacob, say-\\ning: We came to Esau, thy brother, and behold\\nhe cometh with speed to meet thee with four\\nhundred men.\\n7Then Jacob was greatly afraid; and in his\\nfear divided the people that was with him, and\\nthe \\rocks, and the sheep, and the oxen, and the\\ncamels, into two companies,\\n8Saying: If Esau come to one company, and\\ndestroy it, the other company that is left, shall\\nescape.\\n9And Jacob said: O God of my fahter Abra-\\nham, and God of my father Isaac: O Lord who\\nsaidst to me, Return to thy land, and to the place\\nof thy birth, and I will do well for thee.\\n10I am not worthy of the least of all thy mer-\\ncies, and of thy truth which thou hast ful\\x0clled\\nto thy servant. With my sta\\x0b I passed over this\\nJordan; and now I return with two companies.\\n11Deliver me from the hand of my brother\\nEsau, for I am greatly afraid of him; lest perhaps\\nhe come, and kill the mother with the children.\\n12Thou didst say, that thou wouldst do well\\nby me, and multiply my seed like the sand of the\\nsea, which connot be numbered for multitude.\\n13And when he had slept there that night, he\\nset apart, of the things which he had, presents\\nfor his brother Esau,\\n14Two hundred she goats, twenty he goats,\\ntwo hundred ewes, and twenty rams,\\n15Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty\\nkine, and twenty bulls, twenty she asses, and ten\\nof their foals.\\n16And he sent them by the hands of his ser-\\nvants, every drove by itself, and he said to his\\nservants: Go before me, and let there be a space\\nbetween drove and drove.\\n17And he commanded the \\x0crst, saying: If\\nthou meet my brother Esau, and he ask thee:\\nWhose art thou? or whither goest thou? or\\nwhose are these before thee?\\n18Thou shalt answer: Thy servant Jacob's:\\nhe hath sent them as a present to my lord Esau;\\nand he cometh after us.19In like manner he commanded the second,\\nand the third, and all that followed the droves,\\nsaying: Speak ye the same words to Esau, when\\nye \\x0cnd him.\\n20And ye shall add: Thy servant Jacob him-\\nself also followeth after us; for he said: I will\\nappease him with the presents that go before,\\nand afterwards I will see him, perhaps he will be\\ngracious to me.\\n21So the presents went before him, but him-\\nself lodged that night in the camp.\\n22And rising early, he took his two wives and\\nhis two handmaids, with his eleven sons, and\\npassed over the ford of Jaboc.\\n23And when all things were brought over that\\nbelonged to him,\\n24He remained alone; and behold, a man\\nwrestled with him till morning.\\n25And when he saw that he could not over-\\ncome him, he touched the sinew of his thigh, and\\nforthwith it shrank.\\n26And he said to him: Let me go, for it is\\nbreak of day. He answered: I will not let thee\\ngo, except thou bless me.\\n27And he said: What is thy name? He an-\\nswered: Jacob.\\n28But he said: Thy name shall not be called\\nJacob, but Israel; for if thou hast been strong\\nagainst God, how much more shalt thou prevail\\nagainst men?\\n29Jacob asked him: Tell me by what name\\nart thou called? He answered: Why dost thou\\nask my name? And he blessed him in the same\\nplace.\\n30And Jacob called the name of the place\\nPhanuel, saying: I have seen God face to face,\\nand my soul has been saved.\\n31And immediately the sun rose upon him,\\nafter he was past Phanuel; but he halted on his\\nfoot.\\n32Therefore the children of Israel, unto this\\nday, eat not the sinew, that shrank in Jacob's\\nthigh: because he touched the sinew of his thigh\\nand it shrank.\\nChapter 33\\nAnd Jacob lifting up his eyes, saw Esau coming,\\nand with him four hundred men: and he divided\\nthe children of Lia and of Rachel, and of the two\\nhandmaids.\\n2And he put both the handmaids and their\\nchildren foremost: and Lia and her children in\\nthe second place: and Rachel and Joseph last.\\n3And he went forward and bowed down with\\nhis face to the ground seven times, until his\\nbrother came near.\\n4Then Esau ran to meet his brother, and em-\\nbraced him: and clasping him fast about the\\nneck, and kissing him, wept.\\n5And lifting up his eyes, he saw the women\\nand their children, and said: What mean these?\\nAnd do they belong to thee? He answered: They\\nare the children which God hath given to me, thy\\nservant.\\n6Then the handmaids and their children came\\nnear and bowed themselves.\\n7Lia also, with her children, came near and\\nbowed down in like manner; and last of all,\\nJoseph and Rachel bowed down.\\n8And Esau said: What are the droves that\\nI met? He answered: That I might \\x0cnd favour\\nbefore my lord.\\n9But he said: I have plenty, my brother, keep\\nwhat is thine for thyself.\\n10And Jacob said: Do not so I beseech thee,\\nbut if I have found favour in thy eyes, receive a\\nlittle present at my hands: for I have seen thy\\nface, as if I should have seen the countenance ofGod: be gracious to me,\\n11And take the blessing which I have brought\\nthee, and which God hath given me, who giveth\\nall things. He took it with much ado at his\\nbrother's earnest pressing him,\\n12And said: Let us go on together, and I will\\naccompany thee in thy journey.\\n13And Jacob said: My lord, thou knowest\\nthat I have with me tender children, and sheep,\\nand kine with young: which if I should cause to\\nbe overdriven, in one day all the \\rocks will die.\\n14May it please my lord to go before his ser-\\nvant: and I will follow softly after him, as I shall\\nsee my children to be able, until I come to my\\nlord in Seir.\\n15Esau answered: I beseech thee, that some\\nof the people, at least, who are with me, may\\nstay to accompany thee in the way. And he said:\\nThere is no necessity: I want nothing else but\\nonly to \\x0cnd favour, my lord, in thy sight.\\n16So Esau returned that day, the way that\\nhe came, to Seir.\\n17And Jacob came to Socoth: where having\\nbuilt a house, and pitched tents, he called the\\nname of the place Socoth, that is, Tents.\\n18And he passed over to Salem, a city of the\\nSichemites, which is in the land of Chanaan, af-\\nter he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria: and\\nhe dwelt by the town.\\n19And he bought that part of the \\x0celd, in\\nwhich he pitched his tents, of the children of\\nHemor, the father of Sichem, for a hundred\\nlambs.\\n20And raising an altar there, he invoked upon\\nit the most mighty God of Israel.\\nChapter 34\\nAnd Dina the daughter of Lia went out to see\\nthe women of that country.\\n2And when Sichem the son of Hemor the\\nHevite, the prince of that land, saw her, he was\\nin love with her: and took her away, and lay with\\nher, ravishing the virgin.\\n3And his soul was fast knit unto her; and\\nwhereas she was sad, he comforted her with\\nsweet words.\\n4And going to Hemor his father, he said: Get\\nme this damsel to wife.\\n5But when Jacob had heard this, his sons\\nbeing absent, and employed in feeding the cattle,\\nhe held his peace till they came back.\\n6And when Hemor the father of Sichem was\\ncome out to speak to Jacob,\\n7Behold his sons came from the \\x0celd: and\\nhearing what had passed, they were exceeding\\nangry, because he had done a foul thing in Israel,\\nand committed an unlawful act, in ravishing Ja-\\ncob's daughter.\\n8And Hemor spoke to them: The soul of my\\nson Sichem has a longing for your daughter: give\\nher him to wife:\\n9And let us contract marriages one with an-\\nother: give us your daughters, and take you our\\ndaughters.\\n10And dwell with us: the land is at your\\ncommand, till, trade, and possess it.\\n11Sichem also said to her father and to her\\nbrethren: Let me \\x0cnd favour in your sight, and\\nwhatsoever you shall appoint I will give:\\n12Raise the dowry, and ask gifts, and I will\\ngladly give what you shall demand: only give me\\nthis damsel to wife.\\n13The sons of Jacob answered Sichem and his\\nfather deceitfully, being enraged at the de\\rower-\\ning of their sister:14We cannot do what you demand, nor give\\nour sister to one that is uncircumcised; which\\nwith us is unlawful and abominable.\\n15But in this we may be allied with you, if\\nyou will be like us, and all the male sex among\\nyou be circumcised:\\n16Then will we mutually give and take your\\ndaughters, and ours; and we will dwell with you,\\nand will be one people:\\n17But if you will not be circumcised, we will\\ntake our daughter and depart.\\n18Their o\\x0ber pleased Hemor, and Sichem, his\\nson:\\n19And the young man made no delay, but\\nforthwith ful\\x0clled what was required: for he\\nloved the damsel exceedingly, and he was the\\ngreatest man in all his father's house.\\n20And going into the gate of the city, they\\nspoke to the people:\\n21These men are peaceable, and are willing\\nto dwell with us: let them trade in the land, and\\ntill it, which being large and wide wanteth men\\nto till it: we shall take their daughters for wives,\\nand we will give them ours.\\n22One thing there is for which so great a\\ngood is deferred: We must circumcise every male\\namong us, following the manner of the nation.\\n23And their substance, and cattle, and all\\nthat they possess, shall be ours; only in this let us\\ncondescend, and by dwelling together, we shall\\nmake one people.\\n24And they all agreed, and circumcised all\\nthe males.\\n25And behold the third day, when the pain\\nof the wound was greatest: two of the sons of\\nJacob, Simeon and Levi, the brothers of Dina,\\ntaking their swords, entered boldly into the city\\nand slew all the men.\\n26And they killed also Hemor and Sichem,\\nand took away their sister Dina out of Sichem's\\nhouse.\\n27And when they were gone out, the other\\nsons of Jacob came upon the slain; and plun-\\ndered the city in revenge of the rape.\\n28And they took their sheep, and their herds,\\nand their asses, wasting all they had in their\\nhouses and in their \\x0celds.\\n29And their children and wives they took\\ncaptive.\\n30And when they had boldly perpetrated\\nthese things, Jacob said to Simeon and Levi: You\\nhave troubled me, and made me hateful to the\\nChanaanites and Pherezites, the inhabitants of\\nthis land. We are few: they will gather them-\\nselves together and kill me; and both I, and my\\nhouse shall be destroyed.\\n31They answered: Should they abuse our sis-\\nter as a strumpet?\\nChapter 35\\nIn the mean time God said to Jacob: Arise and\\ngo up to Bethel, and dwell there, and make there\\nan altar to God, who appeared to thee when thou\\ndidst \\ree from Esau, thy brother.\\n2And Jacob having called together all his\\nhousehold, said: Cast away the strange gods that\\nare among you, and be cleansed, and change your\\ngarments.\\n3Arise, and let us go up to Bethel, that we\\nmay make there an altar to God; who heard me\\nin the day of my a\\x0fiction, and accompained me\\nin my journey.\\n4So they gave him all the strange gods they\\nhad, and the earrings which were in their ears:\\nand he buried them under the turpentine tree,\\nthat is behind the city of Sichem.\\n5And when they were departed, the terror\\nof God fell upon all the cities round about, andthey durst not pursue after them as they went\\naway.\\n6And Jacob came to Luza, which is in the\\nland of Chanaan, surnamed Bethel: he and all\\nthe people that were with him.\\n7And he built there an altar, and called the\\nname of that place, The house of God: for there\\nGod appeared to him when he \\red from his\\nbrother.\\n8At the same time Debora, the nurse of Re-\\nbecca, died, and was buried at the foot of Bethel,\\nunder an oak, and the name of that place was\\ncalled, The oak of weeping.\\n9And God appeared again to Jacob, after\\nhe returned from Mesopotamia of Syria, and he\\nblessed him,\\n10Saying: Thou shalt not be called any more\\nJacob, but Israel shall be thy name. And he\\ncalled him Israel.\\n11And said to him: I am God almighty, in-\\ncrease thou and be multiplied. Nations and peo-\\nples of nations shall be from thee, and kings shall\\ncome out of thy loins.\\n12And the land which I gave to Abraham and\\nIsaac, I will give to thee, and to thy seed after\\nthee.\\n13And he departed from him.\\n14But he set up a monument of stone, in the\\nplace where God had spoken to him: pouring\\ndrink \\x0berings upon it, and pouring oil thereon:\\n15And calling the name of that place Bethel.\\n16And going forth from thence, he came in\\nthe spring time to the land which leadeth to\\nEphrata: wherein when Rachel was in travail,\\n17By reason of her hard labour, she began to\\nbe in danger, and the midwife said to her: Fear\\nnot, for thou shalt have this son also.\\n18And when her soul was departing for pain,\\nand death was now at hand, she called the name\\nof her son Benoni, that is, the son of my pain:\\nbut his father called him Benjamin, that is, the\\nson of the right hand.\\n19So Rachel died, and was buried in the high-\\nway that leadeth to Ephrata, this is Bethlehem.\\n20And Jacob erected a pillar over her sepul-\\nchre: this is the pillar of Rachel's monument, to\\nthis day.\\n21Departing thence, he pitched his tent be-\\nyond the Flock tower.\\n22And when he dwelt in that country, Ruben\\nwent, and slept with Bala the concubine of his\\nfather: which he was not ignorant of. Now the\\nsons of Jacob were twelve.\\n23The sons of Lia: Ruben the \\x0crst born, and\\nSimeon, and Levi, and Juda, and Issachar, and\\nZabulon.\\n24The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.\\n25The sons of Bala, Rachel's handmaid: Dan\\nand Nephthali.\\n26The sons of Zelpha, Lia's handmaid: Gad\\nand Aser: these are the sons of Jacob, that were\\nborn to him in Mesopotamia of Syria.\\n27And he came to Isaac his father in Mam-\\nbre, the city of Arbee, this is Hebron: wherein\\nAbraham and Isaac sojourned.\\n28And the days of Isaac were a hundred and\\neighty years.\\n29And being spent with age he died, and was\\ngathered to his people, being old and full of days:\\nand his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.\\nChapter 36\\nAnd these are the generations of Esau, the same\\nis Edom.\\n2Esau took wives of the daughters of\\nChanaan: Ada the daughter of Elon the Hethite,\\nand Oolibama the daughter of Ana, the daughter\\nof Sebeon the Hevite:3And Basemath, the daughter of Ismael, sis-\\nter of Nabajoth.\\n4And Ada bore Eliphaz: Basemath bore\\nRahuel.\\n5Oolibama bore Jehus, and Ihelon, and Core.\\nThese are the sons of Esau, that were born to\\nhim in the land of Chanaan.\\n6And Esau took his wives, and his sons and\\ndaughters, and every soul of his house, and his\\nsubstance, and cattle, and all that he was able\\nto acquire in the land of Chanaan: and went into\\nanother country, and departed from his brother\\nJacob.\\n7For they were exceeding rich, and could not\\ndwell together: neither was the land in which\\nthey sojourned able to bear them, for the multi-\\ntude of their \\rocks.\\n8And Esau dwelt in mount Seir: he is Edom.\\n9And these are the generations of Esau, the\\nfather of Edom, in mount Seir.\\n10And these the names of his sons: Eliphaz\\nthe son of Ada, the wife of Esau: and Rahuel,\\nthe son of Basemath, his wife.\\n11And Eliphaz had sons: Theman, Omar,\\nSepho, and Gatham and Cenez.\\n12And Thamna was the concubine of Eliphaz,\\nthe son of Esau: and she bore him Amalech.\\nThese are the sons of Ada, the wife of Esau.\\n13And the sons of Rahuel were Nahath and\\nZara, Samma and Meza.

And Joseph went forward\\nafter his brethren, and found them in Dothain.\\n18And when they saw him afar o\\x0b, before he\\ncame nigh them, they thought to kill him:\\n19And said one to another: Behold the\\ndreamer cometh.\\n20Come, let us kill him, and cast him into\\nsome old pit: and we will say: Some evil beast\\nhath devoured him: and then it shall appear\\nwhat his dreams avail him:\\n21And Ruben hearing this, endeavoured to\\ndeliver him out of their hands, and said:\\n22Do not take away his life, nor shed his\\nblood: but cast him into this pit, that is in the\\nwilderness, and keep your hands harmless: now\\nhe said this, being desirous to deliver him out of\\ntheir hands and to restore him to his father.\\n23And as soon as he came to his brethren,\\nthey forthwith stript him of his outside coat, that\\nwas of divers colours:\\n24And cast him into an old pit where there\\nwas not water.\\n25And sitting down to eat bread, they\\nsaw some Ismaelites on their way coming from\\nGalaad, with their camels, carrying spices, and\\nbalm, and myrrh to Egypt.\\n26And Juda said to his brethren: What will\\nit pro\\x0ct us to kill our brother, and conceal his\\nblood?\\n27It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites,\\nand that our hands be not de\\x0cled: for he is our\\nbrother and our \\resh. His brethren agreed to his\\nwords.\\n28And when the Madianite merchants passed\\nby, they drew him out of the pit, and sold him\\nto the Ismaelites, for twenty pieces of silver: and\\nthey led him into Egypt.\\n29And Ruben returning to the pit, found not\\nthe boy:\\n30And rending his garments he went to his\\nbrethren, and said: The boy doth not appear,\\nand whither shall I go?\\n31And they took his coat, and dipped it in\\nthe blood of a kid, which they had killed:\\n32Sending some to carry it to their father,\\nand to say: This we have found: see whether it\\nbe thy son's coat, or not.\\n33And the father acknowledging it, said: It\\nis my son's coat, an evil wild beast hath eaten\\nhim, a beast hath devoured Joseph.\\n34And tearing his garments, he put on sack-\\ncloth, mourning for his son a long time.\\n35And all his children being gathered to-\\ngether to comfort their father in his sorrow, he\\nwould not receive comfort, but said: I will go\\ndown to my son into hell, mourning. And whilst\\nhe continued weeping,\\n36The Madianites sold Joseph in Egypt to\\nPutiphar, an eunuch of Pharao, captain of the\\nsoldiers.\\nChapter 38\\nAt that time Juda went down from his brethren,\\nand turned in to a certain Odollamite, named\\nHiras.\\n2And he saw there the daughter of a man of\\nChanaan, called Sue: and taking her to wife, he\\nwent in unto her.3And she conceived, and bore a son, and\\ncalled his name Her.\\n4And conceiving again, she bore a son, and\\ncalled him Onan.\\n5She bore also a third: whom she called Sela.\\nAfter whose birth, she ceased to bear any more.\\n6And Juda took a wife for Her, his \\x0crst born,\\nwhose name was Thamar.\\n7And Her, the \\x0crst born of Juda, was wicked\\nin the sight of the Lord: and was slain by him.\\n8Juda, therefore, said to Onan his son: Go in\\nto thy brother's wife and marry her, that thou\\nmayst raise seed to thy brother.\\n9He knowing that the children should not be\\nhis, when he went in to his brother's wife, he\\nspilled his seed upon the ground, lest children\\nshould be born in his brother's name.\\n10And therefore the Lord slew him, because\\nhe did a detestable thing:\\n11Wherefore Juda said to Thamar his\\ndaughter-in-law: Remain a widow in thy father's\\nhouse, till Sela my son grow up: for he was afraid\\nlest he also might die, as his brethren did. She\\nwent her way, and dwelt in her father's house.\\n12And after many days were past: the daugh-\\nter of Sue the wife of Juda died: and when he\\nhad taken comfort after his mourning, he went\\nup to Thamnas, to the shearers of his sheep, he\\nand Hiras the Odollamite, the shepherd of his\\n\\rock.\\n13And it was told Thamar that her father-in-\\nlaw was come up to Thamnas to shear his sheep.\\n14And she put o\\x0b the garments of her widow-\\nhood, and took a veil: and changing her dress,\\nsat in the cross way, that leadeth to Thamnas:\\nbecause Sela was grown up, and she had not been\\nmarried to him.\\n15When Juda saw her, he thought she was\\na harlot: for she had covered her face, lest she\\nshould be known.\\n16And going to her, he said: Su\\x0ber me to\\nlie with thee: for he knew her not to be his\\ndaughter-in-law. And she answered: What wilt\\nthou give me to enjoy my company?\\n17He said: I will send thee a kid out of the\\n\\rock. And when she said again: I will su\\x0ber\\nwhat thou wilt, if thou give me a pledge, till\\nthou send what thou promisest.\\n18Juda said: What wilt thou have for a\\npledge? She answered: Thy ring and bracelet,\\nand the sta\\x0b which thou holdest in thy hand.\\nThe woman therefore at one copulation con-\\nceived.\\n19And she arose and went her way: and\\nputting o\\x0b the apparel which she had taken, put\\non the garments of her widowhood.\\n20And Juda sent a kid by his shepherd, the\\nOdollamite, that he might receive the pledge\\nagain, which he had given to the woman: but\\nhe, not \\x0cnding her,\\n21Asked the men of that place: Where is the\\nwoman that sat in the cross way? And when\\nthey all made answer: There was no harlot in\\nthis place,\\n22He returned to Juda, and said to him: I\\nhave not found her; moreover, the men of that\\nplace said to me, that there never sat a harlot\\nthere.\\n23Juda said: Let her take it to herself, surely\\nshe cannot charge us with a lie, I sent the kid\\nwhich I promised: and thou didst not \\x0cnd her.\\n24And behold, after three months, they told\\nJuda, saying: Thamar, thy daughter-in-law,\\nhath played the harlot, and she appeareth to\\nhave a big belly. And Juda said: Bring her out\\nthat she may be burnt.\\n25But when she was led to execution, she\\nsent to her father in law, saying: By the man, to\\nwhom these things belong, I am with child. See\\nwhose ring, and bracelet, and sta\\x0b this is.26But he acknowledging the gifts, said: She\\nis juster than I: because I did not give her to\\nSela, my son. However he knew her no more.\\n27And when she was ready to be brought to\\nbed, there appeared twins in her womb: and in\\nthe very delivery of the infants, one put forth a\\nhand, whereon the midwife tied a scarlet thread,\\nsaying:\\n28This shall come forth the \\x0crst.\\n29But he drawing back his hand, the other\\ncame forth: and the woman said: Why is the\\npartition divided for thee? and therefore called\\nhis name Phares.\\n30Afterwards his brother came out, on whose\\nhand was the scarlet thread: and she called his\\nname Zara.\\nChapter 39\\nAnd Joseph was brought into Egypt, and\\nPutiphar, an eunuch of Pharao, chief captain of\\nthe army, an Egyptian, bought him of the Is-\\nmaelites, by whom he was brought.\\n2And the Lord was with him, and he was a\\nprosperous man in all things: and he dwelt in\\nhis master's house:\\n3Who knew very well that the Lord was with\\nhim, and made all that he did to prosper in his\\nhand.\\n4And Joseph found favour in the sight of his\\nmaster, and ministered to him: and being set\\nover all by him, he governed the house commit-\\nted to him, and all things that were delivered to\\nhim:\\n5And the Lord blessed the house of the Egyp-\\ntian for Joseph's sake, and multiplied all his sub-\\nstance, both at home and in the \\x0celds.\\n6Neither knew he any other thing, but the\\nbread which he ate. And Joseph was of a beau-\\ntiful countenance, and comely to behold.\\n7And after many days, his mistress cast her\\neyes on Joseph, and said: Lie with me.\\n8But he in no wise consenting to that wicked\\nact said to her: Behold, my master hath deliv-\\nered all things to me, and knoweth not what he\\nhath in his own house:\\n9Neither is there any thing which is not in\\nmy power, or that he hath not delivered to me,\\nbut thee, who art his wife; how then can I do\\nthis wicked thing, and sin against my God?\\n10With such words as these day by day, both\\nthe woman was importunate with the young\\nman, and he refused the adultery.\\n11Now it happened on a certain day, that\\nJoseph went into the house, and was doing some\\nbusiness, without any man with him:\\n12And she catching the skirt of his garment,\\nsaid: Lie with me. But he leaving the garment\\nin her hand, \\red, and went out.\\n13And when the woman saw the garment in\\nher hands, and herself disregarded,\\n14She called to her the men of her house, and\\nsaid to them: See, he hath brought in a Hebrew,\\nto abuse us: he came in to me, to lie with me;\\nand when I cried out,\\n15And he heard my voice, he left the garment\\nthat I held, and got him out.\\n16For a proof therefore of her \\x0cdelity, she\\nkept the garment, and shewed it to her husband\\nwhen he returned home:\\n17And said: The Hebrew servant, whom thou\\nhast brought, came to me to abuse me.\\n18And when he heard me cry, he left the gar-\\nment which I held, and \\red out.\\n19His master hearing these things, and giving\\ntoo much credit to his wife's words, was very\\nangry,\\n20And cast Joseph into the prison, where the\\nking's prisoners were kept, and he was there shutup.\\n21But the Lord was with Joseph, and having\\nmercy upon him gave him favour in the sight of\\nthe chief keeper of the prison:\\n22Who delivered into his hand all the prison-\\ners that were kept in custody: and whatsoever\\nwas done, was under him.\\n23Neither did he himself know any thing, hav-\\ning committed all things to him: for the Lord\\nwas with him, and made all that he did to pros-\\nper.\\nChapter 40\\nAfter this, it came to pass, that two eunuchs,\\nthe butler and the baker of the king of Egypt,\\no\\x0bended their lord.\\n2And Pharao being angry with them, (now\\nthe one was chief butler, the other chief baker,)\\n3He sent them to the prison of the commander\\nof the soldiers, in which Joseph also was prisoner.\\n4But the keeper of the prison delivered them\\nto Joseph, and he served them. Some little time\\npassed, and they were kept in custody.\\n5And they both dreamed a dream the same\\nnight, according to the interpretation agreeing\\nto themselves:\\n6And when Joseph was come into them in the\\nmorning, and saw them sad,\\n7He asked them, saying: Why is your coun-\\ntenance sadder today than usual?\\n8They answered: We have dreamed a dream,\\nand there is nobody to interpret it to us. And\\nJoseph said to them: Doth not interpretation\\nbelong to God? Tell me what you have dreamed:\\n9The chief butler \\x0crst told his dream: I saw\\nbefore me a vine,\\n10On which were three branches, which by\\nlittle and little sent out buds, and after the blos-\\nsoms brought forth ripe grapes:\\n11And the cup of Pharao was in my hand:\\nand I took the grapes, and pressed them into the\\ncup which I held, and I gave the cup to Pharao.\\n12Joseph answered: This is the interpretation\\nof the dream: The three branches, are yet three\\ndays:\\n13After which Pharao will remember thy ser-\\nvice, and will restore thee to thy former place:\\nand thou shalt present him the cup according to\\nthy o\\x0ece, as before thou was wont to do.\\n14Only remember me when it shall be well\\nwith thee, and do me this kindness: to put\\nPharao in mind to take me out of this prison:\\n15For I was stolen away out of the land of the\\nHebrews, and here without any fault was cast\\ninto the dungeon.\\n16The chief baker seeing that he had wisely\\ninterpreted the dream, said: I also dreamed a\\ndream, That I had three baskets of meal upon\\nmy head:\\n17And that in one basket which was upper-\\nmost, I carried all meats that are made by the\\nart of baking, and that the birds ate out of it.\\n18Joseph answered: This is the interpretation\\nof the dream: The three baskets, are yet three\\ndays:\\n19After which Pharao will take thy head from\\nthee, and hang thee on a cross, and the birds\\nshall tear thy \\resh.\\n20The third day after this was the birthday\\nof Pharao: and he made a great feast for his\\nservants, and at the banquet remembered the\\nchief butler, and the chief baker.\\n21And he restored the one to his place, to\\npresent him the cup:\\n22The other he hanged on a gibbet, that the\\ntruth of the interpreter might be shewn.\\n23But the chief butler, when things prospered\\nwith him, forgot his interpreter.Chapter 41\\nAfter two years Pharao had a dream. He thought\\nhe stood by the river,\\n2Out of which came up seven kine, very beau-\\ntiful and fat: and they fed in marshy places.\\n3Other seven also came up out of the river, ill\\nfavoured, and lean \\reshed: and they fed on the\\nvery bank of the river, in green places:\\n4And they devoured them, whose bodies were\\nvery beautiful and well conditioned. So Pharao\\nawoke.\\n5He slept again, and dreamed another dream:\\nSeven ears of corn came up upon one stalk full\\nand fair:\\n6Then seven other ears sprung up thin and\\nblasted,\\n7And devoured all the beauty of the former.\\nPharao awaked after his rest:\\n8And when morning was come, being struck\\nwith fear, he sent to all the interpreters of Egypt,\\nand to all the wise men: and they being called\\nfor, he told them his dream, and there was not\\nany one that could interpret it.\\n9Then at length the chief butler remember-\\ning, said: I confess my sin:\\n10The king being angry with his servants,\\ncommanded me and the chief baker to be cast\\ninto the prison of the captain of the soldiers.\\n11Where in one night both of us dreamed a\\ndream forboding things to come.\\n12There was there a young man a Hebrew,\\nservant to the same captain of the soldiers: to\\nwhom we told our dreams,\\n13And we heard what afterwards the event\\nof the thing proved to be so. For I was restored\\nto my o\\x0ece: and he was hanged upon a gibbet.\\n14Forthwith at the king's command Joseph\\nwas brought out of the prison, and they shaved\\nhim: and changing his apparel brought him in\\nto him.\\n15And he said to him: I have dreamed\\ndreams, and there is no one that can expound\\nthem: Now I have heard that thou art very wise\\nat interpreting them:\\n16Joseph answered: Without me, God shall\\ngive Pharao a prosperous answer.\\n17So Pharao told what he had dreamed:\\nMethought I stood upon the bank of the river,\\n18And seven kine came up out of the river,\\nexceeding beautiful and full of \\resh: and they\\ngrazed on green places in a marshy pasture.\\n19And behold, there followed these, other\\nseven kine, so very ill favoured and lean, that\\nI never saw the like in the land of Egypt:\\n20And they devoured and consumed the for-\\nmer,\\n21And yet gave no mark of their being full:\\nbut were as lean and ill favoured as before. I\\nawoke, and then fell asleep again,\\n22And dreamed a dream: Seven ears of corn\\ngrew up upon one stalk, full and very fair.\\n23Other seven also thin and blasted, sprung\\nof the stalk:\\n24And they devoured the beauty of the for-\\nmer: I told this dream to the conjecturers, and\\nthere is no man that can expound it.\\n25Joseph answered: The king's dream is one:\\nGod hath shewn to Pharao what he is about to\\ndo.\\n26The seven beautiful kine, and the seven full\\nears, are seven years of plenty: and both contain\\nthe same meaning of the dream.\\n27And the seven lean and thin kine that came\\nup after them, and the seven thin ears that were\\nblasted with the burning wind, are seven years\\nof famine to come:\\n28Which shall be ful\\x0clled in this order.29Behold, there shall come seven years of\\ngreat plenty in the whole land of Egypt:\\n30After which shall follow other seven years\\nof so great scarcity, that all the abundance before\\nshall be forgotten: for the famine shall consume\\nall the land,\\n31And the greatness of the scarcity shall de-\\nstroy the greatness of the plenty.\\n32And for that thou didst see the second time\\na dream pertaining to the same thing: it is a\\ntoken of the certainty, and that the word of God\\ncometh to pass, and is ful\\x0clled speedily.\\n33Now therefore let the king provide a wise\\nand industrious man, and make him ruler over\\nthe land of Egypt:\\n34That he may appoint overseers over all the\\ncountries: and gather into barns the \\x0cfth part of\\nthe fruits, during the seven fruitful years,\\n35That shall now presently ensue: and let all\\nthe corn be laid up, under Pharao's hands, and\\nbe reserved in the cities.\\n36And let it be in readiness, against the\\nfamine of seven years to come, which shall op-\\npress Egypt, and the land shall not be consumed\\nwith scarcity.\\n37The counsel pleased Pharao, and all his\\nservants.\\n38And he said to them: Can we \\x0cnd such\\nanother man, that is full of the spirit of God?\\n39He said therefore to Joseph: Seeing God\\nhath shewn thee all that thou hast said, can I\\n\\x0cnd one wiser and one like unto thee?\\n40Thou shalt be over my house, and at the\\ncommandment of thy mouth all the people shall\\nobey: only in the kingly throne will I be above\\nthee.\\n41And again Pharao said to Joseph: Behold,\\nI have appointed thee over the whole land of\\nEgypt.\\n42And he took his ring from his own hand,\\nand gave it into his hand: and he put upon him\\na robe of silk, and put a chain of gold about his\\nneck.\\n43And he made him go up into his second\\nchariot, the crier proclaiming that all should bow\\ntheir knee before him, and that they should know\\nhe was made governor over the whole land of\\nEgypt.\\n44And the king said to Joseph: I am Pharao:\\nwithout thy commandment no man shall move\\nhand or foot in all the land of Egypt.\\n45And he turned his name, and called him\\nin the Egyptian tongue the saviour of the world.\\nAnd he gave him to wife Aseneth, the daughter\\nof Putiphare, priest of Heliopolis. Then Joseph\\nwent out to the land of Egypt.\\n46(Now he was thirty years old when he stood\\nbefore king Pharao), and he went round all the\\ncountries of Egypt.\\n47And the fruitfulness of the seven years\\ncame: and the corn being bound up into sheaves,\\nwas gathered together into the barns of Egypt.\\n48And all the abundance of grain was laid up\\nin every city.\\n49And there was so great abundance of\\nwheat, that it was equal to the sand of the sea,\\nand the plenty exceeded measure.\\n50And before the famine came, Joseph had\\ntwo sons born: whom Aseneth, the daughter of\\nPutiphare, priest of Heliopolis, bore unto him.\\n51And he called the name of the \\x0crstborn\\nManasses, saying: God hath made me to forget\\nall my labours, and my father's house.\\n52And he named the second Ephraim, saying:\\nGod hath made me to grow in the land of my\\npoverty.\\n53Now when the seven years of plenty that\\nhad been in Egypt were passed:\\n54The seven years of scarcity, which Josephhad foretold, began to come: and the famine\\nprevailed in the whole world, but there was bread\\nin all the land of Egypt.\\n55And when there also they began to be fam-\\nished, the people cried to Pharao, for food. And\\nhe said to them: Go to Joseph: and do all that\\nhe shall say to you.\\n56And the famine increased daily in all the\\nland: and Joseph opened all the barns, and sold\\nto the Egyptians: for the famine had oppressed\\nthem also.\\n57And all provinces came into Egypt, to buy\\nfood, and to seek some relief of their want.\\nChapter 42\\nAnd Jacob hearing that food was sold in Egypt,\\nsaid to his sons: Why are ye careless?\\n2I have heard that wheat is sold in Egypt:\\nGo ye down, and buy us necessaries, that we\\nmay live, and not be consumed with want.\\n3So the ten brethren of Joseph went down, to\\nbuy corn in Egypt:\\n4Whilst Benjamin was kept at home by Ja-\\ncob, who said to his brethren: Lest perhaps he\\ntake any harm in the journey.\\n5And they entered into the land of Egypt with\\nothers that went to buy. For the famine was in\\nthe land of Chanaan.\\n6And Joseph was governor in the land of\\nEgypt, and corn was sold by his direction to the\\npeople. And when his brethren had bowed down\\nto him,\\n7And he knew them, he spoke as it were\\nto strangers, somewhat roughly, asking them:\\nWhence came you? They answered: From the\\nland of Chanaan, to buy necessaries of life.\\n8And though he knew his brethren, he was\\nnot known by them.\\n9And remembering the dreams, which for-\\nmerly he had dreamed, he said to them: You are\\nspies. You are come to view the weaker parts of\\nthe land.\\n10But they said: It is not so, my lord; but\\nthy servants are come to buy food.\\n11We are all the sons of one man: we are\\ncome as peaceable men, neither do thy servants\\ngo about any evil.\\n12And he answered them: It is otherwise:\\nyou are come to consider the unfenced parts of\\nthis land.\\n13But they said: We thy servants are twelve\\nbrethren, the sons of one man in the land of\\nChanaan: the youngest is with our father, the\\nother is not living.\\n14He saith, This is it that I said: You are\\nspies.\\n15I shall now presently try what you are: by\\nthe health of Pharao, you shall not depart hence,\\nuntil your youngest brother come.\\n16Send one of you to fetch him: and you shall\\nbe in prison, till what you have said be proved,\\nwhether it be true or false: or else by the health\\nof Pharao you are spies.\\n17So he put them in prison three days.\\n18And the third day he brought them out of\\nprison, and said: Do as I have said, and you shall\\nlive: for I fear God.\\n19If you be peaceable men, let one of your\\nbrethren be bound in prison: and go ye your\\nways, and carry the corn that you have bought,\\nunto your houses.\\n20And bring your youngest brother to me,\\nthat I may \\x0cnd your words to be true, and you\\nmay not die. They did as he had said.\\n21And they talked one to another: We de-\\nserve to su\\x0ber these things, because we have\\nsinned against our brother, seeing the anguish\\nof his soul, when he besought us, and we wouldnot hear: therefore is this a\\x0fiction come upon\\nus.\\n22And Ruben, one of them, said: Did not I\\nsay to you: Do not sin against the boy; and you\\nwould not hear me? Behold his blood is required.\\n23And they knew not that Joseph under-\\nstood, because he spoke to them by an inter-\\npreter.\\n24And he turned himself away a little while,\\nand wept: and returning, he spoke to them.\\n25And taking Simeon, and binding him in\\ntheir presence, he commanded his servants to \\x0cll\\ntheir sacks with wheat, and to put every man's\\nmoney again in their sacks, and to give them\\nbesides provisions for the way: and they did so.\\n26But they having loaded their asses with the\\ncorn went their way.\\n27And one of them opening his sack, to give\\nhis beast provender in the inn, saw the money in\\nthe sack's mouth,\\n28And said to his brethren: My money is\\ngiven me again; behold it is in the sack. And\\nthey were astonished, and troubled, and said to\\none another: What is this that God hath done\\nunto us?\\n29And they came to Jacob their father in the\\nland of Chanaan, and they told him all things\\nthat had befallen them, saying:\\n30The lord of the land spoke roughly to us,\\nand took us to be spies of the country.\\n31And we answered him: We are peaceable\\nmen, and we mean no plot.\\n32We are twelve brethren born of one father:\\none is not living, the youngest is with our father\\nin the land of Chanaan.\\n33And he said to us: Hereby shall I know\\nthat you are peaceable men: Leave one of your\\nbrethren with me, and take ye necessary provi-\\nsion for your houses, and go your ways,\\n34And bring your youngest brother to me,\\nthat I may know you are not spies: and you may\\nreceive this man again, that is kept in prison:\\nand afterwards may have leave to buy what you\\nwill.\\n35When they had told this, they poured out\\ntheir corn, and every man found his money tied\\nin the mouth of his sack: and all being aston-\\nished together,\\n36Their father Jacob said: You have made\\nme to be without children: Joseph is not living,\\nSimeon is kept in bonds, and Benjamin you will\\ntake away: all these evils are fallen upon me.\\n37And Ruben answered him: Kill my two\\nsons, if I bring him not again to thee: deliver\\nhim into my hand, and I will restore him to thee.\\n38But he said: My son shall not go down with\\nyou: his brother is dead, and he is left alone:\\nif any mischief befall him in the land to which\\nyou go, you will bring down my grey hairs with\\nsorrow to hell.\\nChapter 43\\nIn the mean time the famine was heavy upon all\\nthe land.\\n2And when they had eaten up all the corn,\\nwhich they had brought out of Egypt, Jacob said\\nto his sons: Go again, and buy us a little food.\\n3Juda answered: The man declared unto us\\nwith the attestation of an oath, saying: You shall\\nnot see my face, unless you bring your youngest\\nbrother with you.\\n4If therefore thou wilt send him with us, we\\nwill set out together, and will buy necessaries for\\nthee.\\n5But if thou wilt not, we will not go: for the\\nman, as we have often said, declared unto us,\\nsaying: You shall not see my face without youryoungest brother.\\n6Israel said to them: You have done this for\\nmy misery, in that you told him you had also\\nanother brother.\\n7But they answered: The man asked us in or-\\nder concerning our kindred: if our father lived:\\nif we had a brother: and we answered him reg-\\nularly, according to what he demanded: could\\nwe know that he would say: Bring hither your\\nbrother with you?\\n8And Juda said to his father: Send the boy\\nwith me, that we may set forward, and may live:\\nlest both we and our children perish.\\n9I take the boy upon me, require him at my\\nhand: unless I bring him again, and restore him\\nto thee, I will be guilty of sin against thee for\\never.\\n10If delay had not been made, we had been\\nhere again the second time.\\n11Then Israel said to them: If it must needs\\nbe so, do what you will: take of the best fruits of\\nthe land in your vessels, and carry down presents\\nto the man, a little balm, and honey, and storax,\\nmyrrh, turpentine, and almonds.\\n12And take with you double money, and carry\\nback what you found in your sacks, lest perhaps\\nit was done by mistake.\\n13And take also your brother, and go to the\\nman.\\n14And may my almighty God make him\\nfavourable to you: and send back with you your\\nbrother, whom he keepeth, and this Benjamin:\\nand as for me I shall be desolate without chil-\\ndren.\\n15So the men took the presents, and dou-\\nble money, and Benjamin: and went down into\\nEgypt, and stood before Joseph.\\n16And when he had seen them, and Benjamin\\nwith them, he commanded the steward of his\\nhouse, saying: Bring in the men into the house,\\nand kill victims, and prepare a feast: because\\nthey shall eat with me at noon.\\n17He did as he was commanded, and brought\\nthe men into the house.\\n18And they being much afraid, said there\\none to another: Because of the money, which\\nwe carried back the \\x0crst time in our sacks, we\\nare brought in: that he may bring upon us a\\nfalse accusation, and by violence make slaves of\\nus and our asses.\\n19Wherefore, going up to the steward of the\\nhouse, at the door,\\n20They said: Sir, we desire thee to hear us.\\nWe came down once before to buy food:\\n21And when we had bought, and were come\\nto the inn, we opened our sacks, and found our\\nmoney in the mouths of the sacks: which we have\\nnow brought again in the same weight.\\n22And we have brought other money besides,\\nto buy what we want: we cannot tell who put it\\nin our bags.\\n23But he answered: Peace be with you, fear\\nnot: your God, and the God of your father, hath\\ngiven you treasure in your sacks. For the money,\\nwhich you gave me, I have for good. And he\\nbrought Simeon out to them.\\n24And having brought them into the house,\\nhe fetched water, and they washed their feet, and\\nhe gave provender to their asses.\\n25But they made ready the presents, against\\nJoseph came at noon: for they had heard that\\nthey should eat bread there.\\n26Then Joseph came in to his house, and they\\no\\x0bered him the presents, holding them in their\\nhands; and they bowed down with their face to\\nthe ground.\\n27But he courteously saluting them again,\\nasked them, saying: Is the old man your father\\nin health, of whom you told me? Is he yet living?28And they answered: Thy servant our fa-\\nther, is in health; he is yet living. And bowing\\nthemselves, they made obeisance to him.\\n29And Joseph lifting up his eyes, saw Ben-\\njamin, his brother by the same mother, and said:\\nIs this your young brother, of whom you told me?\\nAnd he said: God be gracious to thee, my son.\\n30And he made haste, because his heart was\\nmoved upon his brother, and tears gushed out:\\nand going into his chamber, he wept.\\n31And when he had washed his face, coming\\nout again, he refrained himself, and said: Set\\nbread on the table.\\n32And when it was set on, for Joseph apart,\\nand for his brethren apart, for the Egyptians also\\nthat ate with him apart, (for it is unlawful for\\nthe Egyptians to eat with the Hebrews, and they\\nthink such a feast profane):\\n33They sat before him, the \\x0crstborn accord-\\ning to his birthright, and the youngest according\\nto his age. And they wondered very much;\\n34Taking the messes which they received of\\nhim: and the greater mess came to Benjamin, so\\nthat it exceeded by \\x0cve parts. And they drank,\\nand were merry with him.\\nChapter 44\\nAnd Joseph commanded the steward of his\\nhouse, saying: Fill their sacks with corn, as much\\nas they can hold: and put the money of every one\\nin the top of his sack.\\n2And in the mouth of the younger's sack put\\nmy silver cup, and the price which he gave for\\nthe wheat. And it was so done.\\n3And when the morning arose, they were sent\\naway with their asses.\\n4And when they were now departed out of the\\ncity, and had gone forward a little way: Joseph\\nsending for the steward of his house, said: Arise,\\nand pursue after the men: and when thou hast\\novertaken them, say to them: Why have you re-\\nturned evil for good?\\n5The cup which you have stolen, is that in\\nwhich my lord drinketh, and in which he is wont\\nto divine: you have done a very evil thing.\\n6He did as he had commanded him. And\\nhaving overtaken them, he spoke to them the\\nsame words.\\n7And they answered: Why doth our lord\\nspeak so, as though thy servants had commit-\\nted so heinous a fact?\\n8The money, that we found in the top of our\\nsacks, we brought back to thee from the land of\\nChanaan: how then should it be that we should\\nsteal out of thy lord's house, gold or silver?\\n9With whomsoever of thy servants shall be\\nfound that which thou seekest, let him die, and\\nwe will be the bondmen of my lord.\\n10And he said to them: Let it be according\\nto your sentence: with whomsoever it shall be\\nfound, let him be my servant, and you shall be\\nblameless.\\n11Then they speedily took down their sacks\\nto the ground, and every man opened his sack.\\n12Which when he had searched, beginning at\\nthe eldest, and ending at the youngest, he found\\nthe cup in Benjamin's sack.\\n13Then they rent their garments, and loading\\ntheir asses again, returned into the town.\\n14And Juda at the head of his brethren went\\nin to Joseph (for he was not yet gone out of the\\nplace) and they all together fell down before him\\non the ground.\\n15And he said to them: Why would you do\\nso? know you not that there is no one like me in\\nthe science of divining.\\n16And Juda said to him: What shall we an-\\nswer my lord? or what shall we say, or be ablejustly to allege? God hath found out the iniq-\\nuity of thy servants: behold, we are all bondmen\\nto my lord, both we, and he with whom the cup\\nwas found.\\n17Joseph answered: God forbid that I should\\ndo so: he that stole the cup, he shall be my\\nbondman: and go you away free to your father.\\n18Then Juda coming nearer, said boldly: I\\nbeseech thee, my lord, let thy servant speak a\\nword in thy ears, and be not angry with thy ser-\\nvant: for after Pharao thou art.\\n19My lord. Thou didst ask thy servants the\\n\\x0crst time: Have you a father or a brother.\\n20And we answered thee, my lord: We have\\na father an old man, and a young boy, that was\\nborn in his old age; whose brother by the mother\\nis dead; and he alone is left of his mother, and\\nhis father loveth him tenderly.\\n21And thou saidst to thy servants: Bring him\\nhither to me, and I will set my eyes on him.\\n22We suggested to my lord: The boy cannot\\nleave his father: for if he leave him, he will die.\\n23And thou saidst to thy servants: Except\\nyour youngest brother come with you, you shall\\nsee my face no more.\\n24Therefore when we were gone up to thy\\nservant our father, we told him all that my lord\\nhad said.\\n25And our father said: Go again, and buy us\\na little wheat.\\n26And we said to him: We cannot go: if our\\nyoungest brother go down with us, we will set\\nout together: otherwise, without him we dare\\nnot see the man's face.\\n27Whereunto he answered: You know that\\nmy wife bore me two.\\n28One went out, and you said: A beast de-\\nvoured him; and hitherto he appeareth not.\\n29If you take this also, and any thing befall\\nhim in the way, you will bring down my grey\\nhairs with sorrow unto hell.\\n30Therefore, if I shall go to thy servant, our\\nfather, and the boy be wanting, (whereas his life\\ndependeth upon the life of him,)\\n31And he shall see that he is not with us, he\\nwill die, and thy servants shall bring down his\\ngrey hairs with sorrow unto hell.\\n32Let me be thy proper servant, who took\\nhim into my trust, and promised, saying: If I\\nbring him not again, I will be guilty of sin against\\nmy father for ever.\\n33Therefore I, thy servant, will stay instead\\nof the boy in the service of my lord, and let the\\nboy go up with his brethren.\\n34For I cannot return to my father without\\nthe boy, lest I be a witness of the calamity that\\nwill oppress my father.\\nChapter 45\\nJoseph could no longer refrain himself before\\nmany that stood by: whereupon he commanded\\nthat all should go out, and no stranger be present\\nat their knowing one another.\\n2And he lifted up his voice with weeping,\\nwhich the Egyptians, and all the house of Pharao\\nheard.\\n3And he said to his brethren: I am Joseph:\\nIs my father yet living? His brethren could not\\nanswer him, being struck with exceeding great\\nfear.\\n4And he said mildly to them: Come nearer\\nto me. And when they were come near him, he\\nsaid: I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold\\ninto Egypt.\\n5Be not afraid, and let it not seem to you a\\nhard case that you sold me into these countries:\\nfor God sent me before you into Egypt for your\\npreservation.6For it is two years since the famine began to\\nbe upon the land, and \\x0cve years more remain,\\nwherein there can be neither ploughing nor reap-\\ning.\\n7And God sent me before, that you may be\\npreserved upon the earth, and may have food to\\nlive.\\n8Not by your counsel was I sent hither, but\\nby the will of God: who hath made me as it were\\na father to Pharao, and lord of his whole house,\\nand governor in all the land of Egypt.\\n9Make haste, and go ye up to my father, and\\nsay to him: Thus saith thy son Joseph: God hath\\nmade me lord of the whole land of Egypt; come\\ndown to me, linger not.\\n10And thou shalt dwell in the land of Gessen:\\nand thou shalt be near me, thou and thy sons,\\nand thy sons' sons, thy sheep, and thy herds, and\\nall things that thou hast.\\n11And there I will feed thee, (for there are\\nyet \\x0cve years of famine remaining) lest both thou\\nperish, and thy house, and all things that thou\\nhast.\\n12Behold, your eyes, and the eyes of my\\nbrother Benjamin, see that it is my mouth that\\nspeaketh to you.\\n13You shall tell my father of all my glory, and\\nall things that you have seen in Egypt: make\\nhaste and bring him to me.\\n14And falling upon the neck of his brother\\nBenjamin, he embraced him and wept: and Ben-\\njamin in like manner wept also on his neck.\\n15And Joseph kissed all his brethren, and\\nwept upon every one of them: after which they\\nwere emboldened to speak to him.\\n16And it was heard, and the fame was spread\\nabroad in the king's court: The brethren of\\nJoseph are come; and Pharao with all his family\\nwas glad.\\n17And he spoke to Joseph that he should give\\norders to his brethren, saying: Load your beasts,\\nand go into the land of Chanaan,\\n18And bring away from thence your father\\nand kindred, and come to me; and I will give\\nyou all the good things of Egypt, that you may\\neat the marrow of the land.\\n19Give orders also that they take wagons out\\nof the land of Egypt, for the carriage of their\\nchildren and their wives; and say: Take up your\\nfather, and make haste to come with all speed:\\n20And leave nothing of your household stu\\x0b;\\nfor all the riches of Egypt shall be yours.\\n21And the sons of Israel did as they were\\nbid. And Joseph gave them wagons according to\\nPharao's commandment: and provisions for the\\nway.\\n22He ordered also to be brought out for every\\none of them two robes: but to Benjamin he gave\\nthree hundred pieces of silver, with \\x0cve robes of\\nthe best:\\n23Sending to his father as much money and\\nraiment; adding besides, ten he asses, to carry o\\x0b\\nall the riches of Egypt, and as many she asses,\\ncarrying wheat and bread for the journey.\\n24So he sent away his brethren, and at their\\ndeparting said to them: Be not angry in the way.\\n25And they went up out of Egypt, and came\\ninto the land of Chanaan, to their father Jacob.\\n26And they told him, saying: Joseph, thy\\nson, is living; and he is ruler in all the land of\\nEgypt. Which when Jacob heard, he awaked as\\nit were out of a deep sleep, yet did not believe\\nthem.\\n27They, on the other side, told the whole\\norder of the thing. And when he saw the wagons,\\nand all that he had sent, his spirit revived,\\n28And he said: It is enough for me if Joseph,\\nmy son, be yet living: I will go and see him before\\nI die.Chapter 46\\nAnd Israel taking his journey, with all that he\\nhad, came to the well of the oath, and killing\\nvictims there to the God of his father Isaac,\\n2He heard him, by a vision in the night, call-\\ning him, and saying to him: Jacob, Jacob. And\\nhe answered him: Lo, here I am.\\n3God said to him: I am the most mighty God\\nof thy father; fear not, go down into Egypt, for\\nI will make a great nation of thee there.\\n4I will go down with thee thither, and will\\nbring thee back again from thence: Joseph also\\nshall put his hands upon thy eyes.\\n5And Jacob rose up from the well of the oath:\\nand his sons took him up, with their children and\\nwives in the wagons, which Pharao had sent to\\ncarry the old man,\\n6And all that he had in the land of Chanaan:\\nand he came into Egypt with all his seed;\\n7His sons, and grandsons, daughters, and all\\nhis o\\x0bspring together.\\n8And these are the names of the children of\\nIsrael, that entered into Egypt, he and his chil-\\ndren. His \\x0crstborn Ruben,\\n9The sons of Ruben: Henoch and Phallu, and\\nHesron and Charmi.\\n10The sons of Simeon: Jamuel and Jamin\\nand Ahod, and Jachin and Sohar, and Saul, the\\nson of a woman of Chanaan.\\n11The sons of Levi: Gerson and Caath, and\\nMerari.\\n12The sons of Juda: Her and Onan, and Sela,\\nand Phares and Zara. And Her and Onan died\\nin the land of Chanaan. And sons were born to\\nPhares: Hesron and Hamul.\\n13The sons of Issachar: Thola and Phua, and\\nJob and Semron.\\n14The sons of Zabulon: Sared, and Elon, and\\nJahelel.\\n15These are the sons of Lia, whom she bore in\\nMesopotamia of Syria, with Dina, his daughter.\\nAll the souls of her sons and daughters, thirty-\\nthree.\\n16The sons of Gad: Sephion and Haggi, and\\nSuni and Esebon, and Heri and Arodi, and Areli.\\n17The sons of Aser: Jamne and Jesua, and\\nJessuri and Beria, and Sara their sister. The\\nsons of Beria: Heber and Melchiel.\\n18These are the sons of Zelpha, whom Laban\\ngave to Lia, his daughter. And these she bore to\\nJacob, sixteen souls.\\n19The sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife: Joseph\\nand Benjamin.\\n20And sons were born to Joseph, in the\\nland of Egypt, whom Aseneth, the daughter of\\nPutiphare, priest of Heliopolis, bore him: Man-\\nasses and Ephraim.\\n21The sons of Benjamin: Bela and Bechor,\\nand Asbel and Gera, and Naaman and Echi, and\\nRoss and Mophim, and Ophim and Ared.\\n22These are the sons of Rachel, whom she\\nbore to Jacob: all the souls, fourteen.\\n23The sons of Dan: Husim.\\n24The sons of Nephthali: Jaziel and Guni,\\nand Jeser and Sallem.\\n25These are the sons of Bala, whom Laban\\ngave to Rachel, his daughter: and these she bore\\nto Jacob: all the souls, seven.\\n26All the souls that went with Jacob into\\nEgypt, and that came out of his thigh, besides\\nhis sons' wives, sixty-six.\\n27And the sons of Joseph, that were born to\\nhim in the land of Egypt, two souls. All the souls\\nof the house of Jacob, that entered into Egypt,\\nwere seventy.\\n28And he sent Juda before him to Joseph, to\\ntell him; and that he should meet him in Gessen.\\n29And when he was come thither, Joseph\\nmade ready his chariot, and went up to meethis father in the same place: and seeing him, he\\nfell upon his neck, and embracing him, wept.\\n30And the father said to Joseph: Now shall\\nI die with joy, becuase I have seen thy face, and\\nleave thee alive.\\n31And Joseph said to his brethren, and to\\nall his father's house: I will go up, and will\\ntell Pharao, and will say to him: My brethren,\\nand my father's house, that were in the land of\\nChanaan, are come to me:\\n32And the men are shepherds, and their oc-\\ncupation is to feed cattle; their \\rocks, and herds,\\nand all they have, they have brought with them.\\n33And when he shall call you, and shall say:\\nWhat is your occupation?\\n34You shall answer: We, thy servants, are\\nshepherds, from our infancy until now, both we\\nand our fathers. And this you shall say, that\\nyou may dwell in the land of Gessen, because the\\nEgyptians have all shepherds in abomination.\\nChapter 47\\nThen Joseph went in and told Pharao, saying:\\nMy father and brethren, their sheep and their\\nherds, and all that they possess, are come out of\\nthe land of Chanaan: and behold they stay in\\nthe land of Gessen.\\n2Five men also, the last of his brethren, he\\npresented before the king:\\n3And he asked them: What is your occu-\\npation? They answered: We, thy servants, are\\nshepherds, both we and our fathers.\\n4We are come to sojourn in thy land, because\\nthere is no grass for the \\rocks of thy servants,\\nthe famine being very grievous in the land of\\nChanaan: and we pray thee to give orders that\\nwe thy servants may be in the land of Gessen.\\n5The king therefore said to Joseph: Thy fa-\\nther and thy brethren are come to thee.\\n6The land of Egypt is before thee: and make\\nthem dwell in the best place, and give them the\\nland of Gessen. And if thou knowest that there\\nare industrious men among them, make them\\nrulers over my cattle.\\n7After this Joseph brought in his father to\\nthe king, and presented him before him: and he\\nblessed him.\\n8And being asked by him: How many are the\\ndays of the years of thy life?\\n9He answered: The days of my pilgrimage\\nare a hundred and thirty years, few, and evil,\\nand they are not come up to the days of the\\npilgrimage of my fathers.\\n10And blessing the king, he went out.\\n11But Joseph gave a possession to his fa-\\nther and his brethren in Egypt, in the best place\\nof the land, in Ramesses, as Pharao had com-\\nmanded.\\n12And he nourished them, and all his father's\\nhouse, allowing food to every one.\\n13For in the whole world there was want\\nof bread, and a famine had oppressed the land,\\nmore especially of Egypt and Chanaan;\\n14Out of which he gathered up all the money\\nfor the corn which they bought, and brought it\\nin to the king's treasure.\\n15And when the buyers wanted money, all\\nEgypt came to Joseph, saying: Give us bread:\\nwhy should we die in thy presence, having now\\nno money?\\n16And he answered them: Bring me your cat-\\ntle, and for them I will give you food, if you have\\nno money.\\n17And when they had brought them, he gave\\nthem food in exchange for their horses, and\\nsheep, and oxen, and asses: and he maintained\\nthem that year for the exchange of their cattle.18And they came the second year, and said\\nto him: We will not hide from our lord, how that\\nour money is spent, and our cattle also are gone:\\nneither art thou ignorant that we have nothing\\nnow left but our bodies and our lands.\\n19Why therefore shall we die before thy eyes?\\nwe will be thine, both we and our lands: buy\\nus to be the king's servants, and give us seed,\\nlest for want of tillers the land be turned into a\\nwilderness.\\n20So Joesph bought all the land of Egypt,\\nevery man selling his possessions, because of the\\ngreatness of the famine. And he brought it into\\nPharao's hands:\\n21And all its people from one end of the bor-\\nders of Egypt, even to the other end thereof,\\n22Except the land of the priests, which had\\nbeen given them by the king: to whom also a\\ncertain allowance of food was given out of the\\npublic stores, and therefore they were not forced\\nto sell their possessions.\\n23Then Joseph said to the people: Behold,\\nas you see, both you and your lands belong to\\nPharao; take seed and sow the \\x0celds,\\n24That you may have corn. The \\x0cfth part\\nyou shall give to the king; the other four you\\nshall have for seed, and for food for your families\\nand children.\\n25And they answered: our life is in thy hand;\\nonly let my lord look favourably upon us, and we\\nwill gladly serve the king.\\n26From that time unto this day, in the whole\\nland of Egypt, the \\x0cfth part is paid to the kings,\\nand it is become as a law, except the land of the\\npriests, which was free from this covenant.\\n27So Israel dwelt in Egypt, that is, in the\\nland of Gessen, and possessed it; and grew, and\\nwas multiplied exceedingly.\\n28And he lived in it seventeen years: and all\\nthe days of his life came to a hundred and forty-\\nseven years.\\n29And when he saw that the day of his death\\ndrew nigh, he called his son Joseph, and said\\nto him: If I have found favour in thy sight, put\\nthy hand under my thigh; and thou shalt shew\\nme this kindness and truth, not to bury me in\\nEgypt.\\n30But I will sleep with my fathers, and thou\\nshalt take me away out of this land, and bury\\nme in the burying place of my ancestors. And\\nJoseph answered him: I will do what thou hast\\ncommanded.\\n31And he said: Swear then to me. And as he\\nwas swearing, Israel adored God, turning to the\\nbed's head.\\nChapter 48\\nAfter these things, it was told Joseph that his\\nfather was sick; and he set out to go to him,\\ntaking his two sons Manasses and Ephraim.\\n2And it was told the old man: Behold thy son\\nJoseph cometh to thee. And being strengthened,\\nhe sat on his bed.\\n3And when Joseph was come in to him, he\\nsaid: God almighty apppeared to me at Luza,\\nwhich is in the land of Chanaan, and he blessed\\nme,\\n4And said: I will cause thee to increase and\\nmultiply, and I will make of thee a multitude of\\npeople: and I will give this land to thee, and to\\nthy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.\\n5So thy two sons, who were born to thee in\\nthe land of Egypt before I came hither to thee,\\nshall be mine: Ephraim and Manasses shall be\\nreputed to me as Ruben and Simeon.\\n6But the rest whom thou shalt have after\\nthem, shall be thine, and shall be called by the\\nname of their brethren in their possessions.7For, when I came out of Mesopotamia,\\nRachel died from me in the land of Chanaan in\\nthe very journey, and it was spring time: and I\\nwas going to Ephrata, and I buried her near the\\nway of Ephrata, which by another name is called\\nBethlehem.\\n8Then seeing his sons, he said to him: Who\\nare these?\\n9He answered: They are my sons, whom God\\nhath given me in this place. And he said: Bring\\nthem to me, that I may bless them.\\n10For Israel's eyes were dim by reason of his\\ngreat age, and he could not see clearly. And\\nwhen they were brought to him, he kissed and\\nembraced them,\\n11And said to his son: I am not deprived of\\nseeing thee; moreover God hath shewn me thy\\nseed.\\n12And when Joseph had taken them from his\\nfather's lap, he bowed down with his face to the\\nground.\\n13And he set Ephraim on his right hand, that\\nis, towards the left hand of Israel; but Manasses\\non his left hand, to wit, towards his father's right\\nhand, and brought them near to him.\\n14But he, stretching forth his right hand,\\nput it upon the head of Ephraim, the younger\\nbrother; and the left upon the head of Manasses,\\nwho was the elder, changing his hands.\\n15And Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph, and\\nsaid: God, in whose sight my fathers Abraham\\nand Isaac walked, God that feedeth me from my\\nyouth until this day:\\n16The angel that delivereth me from all evils,\\nbless these boys: and let my name be called upon\\nthem, and the names of my fathers Abraham and\\nIsaac; and may they grow into a multitude upon\\nthe earth.\\n17And Joseph seeing that his father had put\\nhis right hand upon the head of Ephraim, was\\nmuch displeased: and taking his father's hand,\\nhe tried to lift it from Ephraim's head, and to\\nremove it to the head of Manasses.\\n18And he said to his father: It should not be\\nso, my father; for this is the \\x0crstborn, put thy\\nright hand upon his head.\\n19But he refusing, said: I know, my son, I\\nknow: and this also shall become a people, and\\nshall be multiplied; but his younger brother shall\\nbe greater than he; and his seed shall grow into\\nnations.\\n20And he blessed them at that time, saying:\\nIn thee shall Israel be blessed, and it shall be\\nsaid: God do to thee as to Ephraim, and as to\\nManasses.

So I will go up and bury my father,\\nand return.\\n6And Pharao said to him: Go up and bury\\nthy father according as he made thee swear.\\n7So he went up, and there went with him all\\nthe ancients of Pharao's house, and all the elders\\nof the land of Egypt.\\n8And the house of Joseph with his brethren,\\nexcept their children, and their \\rocks and herds,\\nwhich they left in the land of Gessen.\\n9He had also in his train chariots and horse-\\nmen: and it was a great company.\\n10And they came to the threshing \\roor\\nof Atad, which is situated beyond the Jordan:\\nwhere celebrating the exequies with a great and\\nvehement lamentation, they spent full seven\\ndays.\\n11And when the inhabitants of Chanaan saw\\nthis, they said: This is a great mourning to the\\nEgyptians. And therefore the name of that place\\nwas called, The mourning of Egypt.\\n12So the sons of Jacob did as he had com-\\nmanded them.\\n13And carrying him into the land of\\nChanaan, they buried him in the double cave,\\nwhich Abraham had bought together with the\\n\\x0celd for a possession of a burying place, of Eh-\\npron, the Hethite, over against Mambre.\\n14And Joseph returned into Egypt with his\\nbrethren, and all that were in his company, after\\nhe had buried his father.\\n15Now he being dead, his brethren were\\nafraid, and talked one with another: Lest per-\\nhaps he should remember the wrong he su\\x0bered,\\nand requite us all the evil that we did to him.\\n16And they sent a message to him, saying:\\nThy father commanded us before he died,\\n17That we should say thus much to thee from\\nhim: I beseech thee to forget the wickedness of\\nthy brethren, and the sin and malice they prac-\\ntised against thee: we also pray thee, to forgive\\nthe servants of the God of thy father this wicked-\\nness. And when Joseph heard this, he wept.\\n18And his brethren came to him; and wor-\\nshipping prostrate on the ground, they said: We\\nare thy servants.\\n19And he answered them: Fear not: can we\\nresist the will of God?\\n20You thought evil against me: but God\\nturned it into good, that he might exalt me, as\\nat present you see, and might save many people.\\n21Fear not: I will feed you and your children.\\nAnd he comforted them, and spoke gently and\\nmildly.\\n22And he dwelt in Egypt with all his father's\\nhouse; and lived a hundred and ten years. And\\nhe saw the children of Ephraim to the third gen-\\neration. The children also of Machir, the sons of\\nManasses, were born on Joseph's knees.\\n23After which he told his brethren: God will\\nvisit you after my death, and will make you go\\nup out of this land, to the land which he swore\\nto Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.24And he made them swear to him, saying:\\nGod will visit you, carry my bones with you out\\nof this place:\\n25And he died, being a hundred and ten years\\nold.

And Abel was a shepherd, and Cain a\\nhusbandman.\\n3And it came to pass after many days, that\\nCain o\\x0bered, of the fruits of the earth, gifts to\\nthe Lord.\\n4Abel also o\\x0bered of the \\x0crstlings of his \\rock,\\nand of their fat: and the Lord had respect to\\nAbel, and to his o\\x0berings.\\n5But to Cain and his o\\x0berings he had no re-\\nspect: and Cain was exceeding angry, and his\\ncountenance fell.\\n6And the Lord said to him: Why art thou\\nangry? and why is thy countenance fallen?\\n7If thou do well, shalt thou not receive? but\\nif ill, shall not sin forthwith be present at the\\ndoor? but the lust thereof shall be under thee,\\nand thou shalt have dominion over it.\\n8And Cain said to Abel his brother: Let us go\\nforth abroad. And when they were in the \\x0celd,\\nCain rose up against his brother Abel, and slew\\nhim.\\n9And the Lord said to Cain: Where is thy\\nbrother Abel? And he answered: I know not:\\nam I my brother's keeper?\\n10And he said to him: What hast thou done?\\nthe voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from\\nthe earth.\\n11Now therefore cursed shalt thou be upon\\nthe earth, which hath opened her mouth and re-\\ncieved the blood of thy brother at thy hand.\\n12When thou shalt till it, it shall not yield\\nto thee its fruit: a fugitive and a vagabond shalt\\nthou be upon the earth.\\n13And Cain said to the Lord: My iniquity is\\ngreater than that I may deserve pardon.\\n14Behold thou dost cast me out this day from\\nthe face of the earth, and from thy face I shall be\\nhid, and I shall be a vagabond and a fugitive on\\nthe earth: every one therefore that \\x0cndeth me,\\nshall kill me.\\n15And the Lord said to him: No, it shall\\nnot so be: but whosoever shall kill Cain, shall\\nbe punished sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark\\nupon Cain, that whosoever found him should not\\nkill him.\\n16And Cain went out from the face of the\\nLord, and dwelt as a fugitive on the earth at the\\neast side of Eden.\\n17And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived,\\nand brought forth Henoch: and he built a city,\\nand called the name thereof by the name of his\\nson Henoch.\\n18And Henoch begot Irad, and Irad be-\\ngot Maviael, and Maviael begot Mathusael, and\\nMathusael begot Lamech,\\n19Who took two wives: the name of the one\\nwas Ada, and the name of the other Sella.\\n20And Ada brought forth Jabel: who was the\\nfather of such as dwell in tents, and of herdsmen.\\n21And his brother's name was Jubal: he was\\nthe father of them that play upon the harp and\\nthe organs.\\n22Sella also brought forth Tubalcain, who\\nwas a hammerer and arti\\x0ccer in every work ofbrass and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was\\nNoema.\\n23And Lamech said to his wives Ada and\\nSella: Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hear-\\nken to my speech: for I have slain a man to the\\nwounding of myself, and a stripling to my own\\nbruising.\\n24Sevenfold vengeance shall be taken for\\nCain: but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold.\\n25Adam also knew his wife again: and she\\nbrought forth a son, and called his name Seth,\\nsaying: God hath given me another seed for\\nAbel, whom Cain slew.\\n26But to Seth also was born a son, whom\\nhe called Enos: this man began to call upon the\\nname of the Lord.\\nChapter 5\\nThis is the book of the generation of Adam. In\\nthe day that God created man, he made him to\\nthe likeness of God.\\n2He created them male and female; and\\nblessed them: and called their name Adam, in\\nthe day when they were created.\\n3And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years,\\nand begot a son to his own image and likeness,\\nand called his name Seth.\\n4And the days of Adam, after he begot Seth,\\nwere eight hundred years: and he begot sons and\\ndaughters.\\n5And all the time that Adam lived, came to\\nnine hundred and thirty years, and he died.\\n6Seth also lived a hundred and \\x0cve years, and\\nbegot Enos.\\n7And Seth lived after he begot Enos, eight\\nhundred and seven years, and begot sons and\\ndaughters.\\n8And all the days of Seth were nine hundred\\nand twelve years, and he died.\\n9And Enos lived ninety years, and begot\\nCainan.\\n10After whose birth he lived eight hundred\\nand \\x0cfteen years, and begot sons and daughters.\\n11And all the days of Enos were nine hundred\\nand \\x0cve years, and he died.\\n12And Cainan lived seventy years, and begot\\nMalaleel.\\n13And Cainan lived after he begot Malaleel,\\neight hundred and forty years, and begot sons\\nand daughters.\\n14And all the days of Cainan were nine hun-\\ndred and ten years, and he died.\\n15And Malaleel lived sixty-\\x0cve years and be-\\ngot Jared.\\n16And Malaleel lived after he begot Jared,\\neight hundred and thirty years, and begot sons\\nand daughters.\\n17And all the days of Malaleel were eight\\nhundred and ninety-\\x0cve years, and he died.\\n18And Jared lived a hundred and sixty-two\\nyears, and begot Henoch.\\n19And Jared lived after he begot Henoch,\\neight hundred years, and begot sons and daugh-\\nters.\\n20And all the days of Jared were nine hun-\\ndred and sixty-two years, and he died.\\n21And Henoch lived sixty-\\x0cve years, and be-\\ngot Mathusala.\\n22And Henoch walked with God: and lived\\nafter he begot Mathusala, three hundred years,\\nand begot sons and daughters.\\n23And all the days of Henoch were three hun-\\ndred and sixty-\\x0cve years.\\n24And he walked with God, and was seen no\\nmore: because God took him.\\n25And Mathusala lived a hundred and eighty-\\nseven years, and begot Lamech.26And Mathlusala lived after he begot\\nLamech, seven hundred and eighty-two years,\\nand begot sons and daughters.\\n27And all the days of Mathusala were nine\\nhundred and sixty-nine years, and he died.\\n28And Lamech lived a hundred and eighty-\\ntwo years, and begot a son.\\n29And he called his name Noe, saying:\\nThis same shall comfort us from the works and\\nlabours of our hands on the earth, which the\\nLord hath cursed.\\n30And Lamech lived after he begot Noe, \\x0cve\\nhundred and ninety-\\x0cve years, and begot sons\\nand daughters.\\n31And all the days of Lamech came to seven\\nhundred and seventy-seven years, and he died.\\nAnd Noe, when he was \\x0cve hundred years old,\\nbegot Sem, Cham, and Japheth.\\nChapter 6\\nAnd after that men began to be multiplied upon\\nthe earth, and daughters were born to them,\\n2The sons of God seeing the daughters of\\nmen, that they were fair, took to themselves\\nwives of all which they chose.\\n3And God said: My spirit shall not remain\\nin man for ever, because he is \\resh, and his days\\nshall be a hundred and twenty years.\\n4Now giants were upon the earth in those\\ndays. For after the sons of God went in to the\\ndaughters of men, and they brought forth chil-\\ndren, these are the mighty men of old, men of\\nrenown.\\n5And God seeing that the wickedness of men\\nwas great on the earth, and that all the thought\\nof their heart was bent upon evil at all times,\\n6It repented him that he had made man on\\nthe earth.

Noe therefore understood that the\\nwaters were ceased upon the earth.\\n12And he stayed yet other seven days: and\\nhe sent forth the dove, which returned not any\\nmore unto him.\\n13Therefore in the six hundredth and \\x0crst\\nyear, the \\x0crst month, the \\x0crst day of the month,\\nthe waters were lessened upon the earth, and\\nNoe opening the covering of the ark, looked, and\\nsaw that the face of the earth was dried.\\n14In the second month, the seven and twen-\\ntieth day of the month, the earth was dried.\\n15And God spoke to Noe, saying:\\n16Go out of the ark, thou and thy wife, thy\\nsons and the wives of thy sons with thee.\\n17All living things that are with thee of all\\n\\resh, as well in fowls as in beasts, and all creep-\\ning things that creep upon the earth, bring out\\nwith thee, and go ye upon the earth: increase\\nand multiply upon it.\\n18So Noe went out, he and his sons: his wife,\\nand the wives of his sons with him.\\n19And all living things, and cattle, and creep-\\ning things that creep upon the earth, according\\nto their kinds went out of the ark.20And Noe built an altar unto the Lord: and\\ntaking of all cattle and fowls that were clean,\\no\\x0bered holocausts upon the altar.\\n21And the Lord smelled a sweet savour, and\\nsaid: I will no more curse the earth for the sake of\\nman: for the imagination and thought of man's\\nheart are prone to evil from his youth: therefore\\nI will no more destroy every living soul as I have\\ndone.\\n22All the days of the earth, seedtime and har-\\nvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, night\\nand day, shall not cease.\\nChapter 9\\nAnd God blessed Noe and his sons. And he\\nsaid to them: Increase, and multiply, and \\x0cll the\\nearth.\\n2And let the fear and dread of you be upon\\nall the beasts of the earth, and upon all the fowls\\nof the air, and all that move upon the earth: all\\nthe \\x0cshes of the sea are delivered into your hand.\\n3And every thing that moveth, and liveth\\nshall be meat for you: even as the green herbs\\nhave I delivered them all to you:\\n4Saving that \\resh with blood you shall not\\neat.\\n5For I will require the blood of your lives at\\nthe hand of every beast, and at the hand of man,\\nat the hand of every man, and of his brother, will\\nI require the life of man.\\n6Whosoever shall shed man's blood, his blood\\nshall be shed: for man was made to the image of\\nGod.\\n7But increase you and multiply, and go upon\\nthe earth and \\x0cll it.\\n8Thus also said God to Noe, and to his sons\\nwith him:\\n9Behold I will establish my covenant with\\nyou, and with your seed after you:\\n10And with every living soul that is with you,\\nas well in all birds, as in cattle and beasts of the\\nearth, that are come forth out of the ark, and in\\nall the beasts of the earth.\\n11I will establish my covenant with you, and\\nall \\resh shall be no more destroyed with the wa-\\nters of a \\rood, neither shall there be from hence-\\nforth a \\rood to waste the earth.\\n12And God said: This is the sign of the\\ncovenant which I give between me and you, and\\nto every living soul that is with you, for perpet-\\nual generations.\\n13I will set my bow in the clouds, and it shall\\nbe the sign of a covenant between me and be-\\ntween the earth.\\n14And when I shall cover the sky with clouds,\\nmy bow shall appear in the clouds:\\n15And I will remember my covenant with\\nyou, and with every living soul that beareth\\n\\resh: and there shall no more be waters of a\\n\\rood to destroy all \\resh.\\n16And the bow shall be in the clouds, and I\\nshall see it, and shall remember the everlasting\\ncovenant, that was made between God and every\\nliving soul of all \\resh which is upon the earth.\\n17And God said to Noe: This shall be the\\nsign of the covenant, which I have established,\\nbetween me and all \\resh upon the earth.\\n18And the sons of Noe, who came out of the\\nark, were Sem, Cham, and Japheth: and Cham\\nis the father of Chanaan.\\n19These three are the sons of Noe: and from\\nthese was all mankind spread over the whole\\nearth.\\n20And Noe a husbandman began to till the\\nground, and planted a vineyard.\\n21And drinking of the wine was made drunk,\\nand was uncovered in his tent.22Which when Cham the father of Chanaan\\nhad seen, to wit, that his father's nakedness was\\nuncovered, he told it to his two brethren without.\\n23But Sem and Japheth put a cloak upon\\ntheir shoulders, and going backward, covered the\\nnakedness of their father: and their faces were\\nturned away, and they saw not their father's\\nnakedness.\\n24And Noe awaking from the wine, when he\\nhad learned what his younger son had done to\\nhim,\\n25He said: Cursed be Chanaan, a servant of\\nservants shall he be unto his brethren.\\n26And he said: Blessed be the Lord God of\\nSem, be Chanaan his servant.\\n27May God enlarge Japheth, and may he\\ndwell in the tents of Sem, and Chanaan be his\\nservant.\\n28And Noe lived after the \\rood three hun-\\ndred and \\x0cfty years.\\n29And all his days were in the whole nine\\nhundred and \\x0cfty years: and he died.\\nChapter 10\\nThese are the generations of the sons of Noe:\\nSem, Cham, and Japheth: and unto them sons\\nwere born after the \\rood.\\n2The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog,\\nand Madai, and Javan, and Thubal, and Mosoch,\\nand Thiras.\\n3And the sons of Gomer: Ascenez and\\nRiphath and Thogorma.\\n4And the sons of Javan: Elisa and Tharsis,\\nCetthim and Dodanim.\\n5By these were divided the islands of the Gen-\\ntiles in their lands, every one according to his\\ntongue and their families in their nations.\\n6And the Sons of Cham: Chus, and Mesram,\\nand Phuth, and Chanaan.\\n7And the sons of Chus: Saba, and Hevila,\\nand Sabatha, and Regma, and Sabatacha. The\\nsons of Regma: Saba, and Dadan.\\n8Now Chus begot Nemrod: he began to be\\nmighty on the earth.\\n9And he was a stout hunter before the Lord.\\nHence came a proverb: Even as Nemrod the\\nstout hunter before the Lord.\\n10And the beginning of his kingdom was\\nBabylon, and Arach, and Achad, and Chalanne\\nin the land of Sennaar.\\n11Out of that land came forth Assur, and\\nbuilt Ninive, and the streets of the city, and\\nChale.\\n12Resen also between Ninive and Chale: this\\nis the great city.\\n13And Mesraim begot Ludim, and Anamim\\nand Laabim, Nephthuim.\\n14And Phetrusim, and Chasluim; of whom\\ncame forth the Philistines, and the Capthorim.\\n15And Chanaan begot Sidon his \\x0crstborn,\\nthe Hethite,\\n16And the Jebusite, and the Amorrhite, and\\nthe Gergesite.\\n17The Hevite and Aracite: the Sinite,\\n18And the Aradian, the Samarite, and the\\nHamathite: and afterwards the families of the\\nChanaanites were spread abroad.\\n19And the limits of Chanaan were from Sidon\\nas one comes to Gerara even to Gaza, until thou\\nenter Sodom and Gomorrha, and Adama, and\\nSeboim even to Lesa.\\n20These are the children of Cham in their kin-\\ndreds and tongues, and generations, and lands,\\nand nations.\\n21Of Sem also the father of all the children of\\nHeber, the elder brother of Japheth, sons were\\nborn.22The sons of Sem: Elam and Assur, and\\nArphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.\\n23The sons of Aram: Us, and Hull, and\\nGether; and Mes.\\n24But Arphaxad begot Sale, of whom was\\nborn Heber.\\n25And to Heber were born two sons: the\\nname of the one was Phaleg, because in his days\\nwas the earth divided: and his brother's name\\nJectan.\\n26Which Jectan begot Elmodad, and Saleph,\\nand Asarmoth, Jare,\\n27And Aduram, and Uzal, and Decla,\\n28And Ebal, and Abimael, Saba,\\n29And Ophir, and Hevila, and Jobab.

By these were the\\nnations divided on the earth after the \\rood.\\nChapter 11\\nAnd the earth was of one tongue, and of the same\\nspeech.\\n2And when they removed from the east, they\\nfound a plain in the land of Sennaar, and dwelt\\nin it.\\n3And each one said to his neighbour: Come\\nlet us make brick, and bake them with \\x0cre.

And\\nAran begot Lot.\\n28And Aran died before Thare his father, in\\nthe land of his nativity in Ur of the Chaldees.\\n29And Abram and Nachor married wives: the\\nname of Abram's wife was Sarai: and the name\\nof Nachor's wife, Melcha, the daughter of Aran,\\nfather of Melcha and father of Jescha.\\n30And Sarai was barren, and had no children.\\n31And Thare took Abram his son, and Lot\\nthe son of Aran, his son's son, and Sarai his\\ndaughter in law, the wife of Abram his son, and\\nbrought them out of Ur of the Chaldees, to go\\ninto the land of Chanaan: and they came as far\\nas Haran, and dwelt there.\\n32And the days of Thare were two hundred\\nand \\x0cve years, and he died in Haran.\\nChapter 12\\nAnd the Lord said to Abram: Go forth out of\\nthy country, and from thy kindred, and out of\\nthy father's house, and come into the land which\\nI shall shew thee.\\n2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I\\nwill bless thee, and magnify thy name, and thou\\nshalt be blessed.\\n3I will bless them that bless thee, and curse\\nthem that curse thee, and IN THEE shall all the\\nkindreds of the earth be blessed.\\n4So Abram went out as the Lord had com-\\nmanded him, and Lot went with him: Abram\\nwas seventy-\\x0cve years old when he went forth\\nfrom Haran.\\n5And he took Sarai his wife, and Lot his\\nbrother's son, and all the substance which they\\nhad gathered, and the souls which they had got-\\nten in Haran: and they went out to go into the\\nland of Chanaan. And when they were come into\\nit,\\n6Abram passed through the country unto the\\nplace of Sichem, as far as the noble vale: now\\nthe Chanaanite was at that time in the land.\\n7And the Lord appeared to Abram, and said\\nto him: To thy seed will I give this land. And\\nhe built there an altar to the Lord, who had ap-\\npeared to him.\\n8And passing on from thence to a mountain,\\nthat was on the east side of Bethel, he there\\npitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and\\nHai on the east: he built there also an altar to\\nthe Lord, and called upon his name.\\n9And Abram went forward, going and pro-\\nceeding on to the south.\\n10And there came a famine in the country:\\nand Abram went down into Egypt, to sojourn\\nthere: for the famine was very grievous in the\\nland.11And when he was near to enter into Egypt,\\nhe said to Sarai his wife: I know that thou art a\\nbeautiful woman:\\n12And that when the Egyptians shall see\\nthee, they will say: She is his wife: and they\\nwill kill me, and keep thee.\\n13Say, therefore, I pray thee, that thou art\\nmy sister: that I may be well used for thee, and\\nthat my soul may live for thy sake.\\n14And when Abram was come into Egypt,\\nthe Egyptians saw the woman that she was very\\nbeautiful.\\n15And the princes told Pharao, and praised\\nher before him: and the woman was taken into\\nthe house of Pharao.\\n16And they used Abram well for her sake.\\nAnd he had sheep and oxen and he asses, and\\nmen servants, and maid servants, and she asses,\\nand camels.\\n17But the Lord scourged Pharao and his\\nhouse with most grievous stripes for Sarai,\\nAbram's wife.\\n18And Pharao called Abram, and said to him:\\nWhat is this that thou hast done to me? Why\\ndidst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?\\n19For what cause didst thou say, she was thy\\nsister, that I might take her to my wife? Now\\ntherefore there is thy wife, take her, and go thy\\nway.\\n20And Pharao gave his men orders concern-\\ning Abram: and they led him away and his wife,\\nand all that he had.\\nChapter 13\\nAnd Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his\\nwife, and all that he had, and Lot with him into\\nthe south.\\n2And he was very rich in possession of gold\\nand silver.\\n3And he returned by the way, that he came,\\nfrom the south to Bethel, to the place where be-\\nfore he had pitched his tent between Bethel and\\nHai,\\n4In the place of the altar which he had made\\nbefore, and there he called upon the name of the\\nLord.\\n5But Lot also, who was with Abram, had\\n\\rocks of sheep, and herds of beasts, and tents.\\n6Neither was the land able to bear them, that\\nthey might dwell together: for their substance\\nwas great, and they could not dwell together.\\n7Whereupon also there arose a strife between\\nthe herdsmen of Abram and of Lot. And at that\\ntime the Chanaanite and the Pherezite dwelled\\nin that country.\\n8Abram therefore said to Lot: Let there be\\nno quarrel, I beseech thee, between me and thee,\\nand between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen:\\nfor we are brethren.\\n9Behold the whole land is before thee: depart\\nfrom me, I pray thee: if thou wilt go to the left\\nhand, I will take the right: if thou choose the\\nright hand, I will pass to the left.\\n10And Lot lifting up his eyes, saw all the\\ncountry about the Jordan, which was watered\\nthroughout, before the Lord destroyed Sodom\\nand Gomorrha, as the paradise of the Lord, and\\nlike Egypt as one comes to Segor.\\n11And Lot chose to himself the country about\\nthe Jordan, and he departed from the east: and\\nthey were separated one brother from the other.\\n12Abram dwelt in the land of Chanaan: and\\nLot abode in the towns, that were about the Jor-\\ndan, and dwelt in Sodom.\\n13And the men of Sodom were very wicked,\\nand sinners before the face of the Lord beyond\\nmeasure.14And the Lord said to Abram, after Lot\\nwas separated from him: Lift up thy eyes, and\\nlook from the place wherein thou now art, to the\\nnorth and to the south, to the east and to the\\nwest.\\n15All the land which thou seest, I will give to\\nthee, and to thy seed for ever.\\n16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the\\nearth: if any man be able to number the dust of\\nthe earth, he shall be able to number thy seed\\nalso.\\n17Arise and walk through the land in the\\nlength, and the breadth thereof: for I will give it\\nto thee.\\n18So Abram removing his tent, came, and\\ndwelt by the vale of Mambre, which is in Hebron:\\nand he built there an altar to the Lord.\\nChapter 14\\nAnd it came to pass at that time, that Amraphel,\\nking of Sennaar, and Arioch, king of Pontus,\\nand Chodorlahomor, king of the Elamites, and\\nThadal, king of nations,\\n2Made war against Bara, king of Sodom, and\\nagainst Bersa, king of Gomorrha, and against\\nSennaab, king of Adama, and against Semeber,\\nking of Seboim, and against the king of Bala,\\nwhich is Segor.\\n3All these came together into the woodland\\nvale, which now is the salt sea.\\n4For they had served Chodorlahomor twelve\\nyears, and in the thirteenth year they revolted\\nfrom him.\\n5And in the fourteenth year came Chodorla-\\nhomor, and the kings that were with him: and\\nthey smote the Raphaim in Astarothcarnaim,\\nand the Zuzim with them, and the Emim in Save\\nof Cariathaim.\\n6And the Chorreans in the mountains of Seir,\\neven to the plains of Pharan, which is in the\\nwilderness.\\n7And they returned, and came to the foun-\\ntain of Misphat, the same is Cades: and they\\nsmote all the country of the Amalecites, and the\\nAmorrhean that dwelt in Asasonthamar.\\n8And the king of Sodom, and the king of Go-\\nmorrha, and the king of Adama, and the king\\nof Seboim, and the king of Bala, which is Segor,\\nwent out: and they set themselves against them\\nin battle array, in the woodland vale:\\n9To wit, against Chodorlahomor king of the\\nElamites, and Thadal king of nations, and Am-\\nraphel king of Sennaar, and Arioch king of Pon-\\ntus: four kings against \\x0cve.\\n10Now the woodland vale had many pits of\\nslime. And the king of Sodom, and the king\\nof Gomorrha turned their backs, and were over-\\nthrown there: and they that remained, \\red to\\nthe mountain.\\n11And they took all the substance of the\\nSodomites, and Gomorrhites, and all their vict-\\nuals, and went their way:\\n12And Lot also, the son of Abram's brother,\\nwho dwelt in Sodom, and his substance.\\n13And behold one, that had escaped, told\\nAbram the Hebrew, who dwelt in the vale of\\nMambre the Amorrhite, the brother of Escol,\\nand the brother of Aner: for these had made\\na league with Abram.\\n14Which when Abram had heard, to wit, that\\nhis brother Lot was taken, he numbered of the\\nservants born in his house, three hundred and\\neighteen, well appointed: and pursued them to\\nDan.\\n15And dividing his company, he rushed upon\\nthem in the night, and defeated them: and pur-\\nsued them as far as Hoba, which is on the left\\nhand of Damascus.16And he brought back all the substance, and\\nLot his brother, with his substance, the women\\nalso, and the people.\\n17And the king of Sodom went out to meet\\nhim, after he returned from the slaughter of\\nChodorlahomor, and of the kings that were with\\nhim in the vale of Save, which is the king's vale.\\n18But Melchisedech, the king of Salem, bring-\\ning forth bread and wine, for he was the priest\\nof the most high God,\\n19Blessed him, and said: Blessed be Abram\\nby the most high God, who created heaven and\\nearth.\\n20And blessed be the most high God, by\\nwhose protection, the enemies are in thy hands.\\nAnd he gave him the tithes of all.\\n21And the king of Sodom said to Abram:\\nGive me the persons, and the rest take to thyself.\\n22And he answered him: I lift up my hand\\nto the Lord God the most high, the possessor of\\nheaven and earth,\\n23That from the very woofthread unto the\\nshoe latchet, I will not take of any things that\\nare thine, lest thou say: I have enriched Abram.\\n24Except such things as the young men have\\neaten, and the shares of the men that came with\\nme, Aner, Escol, and Mambre: these shall take\\ntheir shares.\\nChapter 15\\nNow when these things were done, the word of\\nthe Lord came to Abram by a vision, saying:\\nFear not, Abram, I am thy protector, and thy\\nreward exceeding great.\\n2And Abram said: Lord God, what wilt thou\\ngive me? I shall go without children: and the\\nson of the steward of my house is this Damascus\\nEliezer.\\n3And Abram added: But to me thou hast not\\ngiven seed: and lo my servant born in my house,\\nshall be my heir.\\n4And immediately the word of the Lord came\\nto him, saying : He shall not be thy heir: but\\nhe that shall come out of thy bowels, him shalt\\nthou have for thy heir.\\n5And he brought him forth abroad, and said\\nto him: Look up to heaven and number the stars\\nif thou canst. And he said to him: So shall thy\\nseed be.\\n6Abram believed God, and it was reputed to\\nhim unto justice.\\n7And he said to him: I am the Lord who\\nbrought thee out from Ur of the Chaldees, to give\\nthee this land, and that thou mightest possess it.\\n8But he said: Lord God, whereby may I know\\nthat I shall possess it?\\n9And the Lord answered, and said: Take me\\na cow of three years old, and a she goat of three\\nyears. and a ram of three years, a turtle also,\\nand a pigeon.\\n10And he took all these, and divided them\\nin the midst, and laid the two pieces of each one\\nagainst the other: but the birds he divided not.\\n11And the fowls came down upon the car-\\ncasses, and Abram drove them away.\\n12And when the sun was setting, a deep sleep\\nfell upon Abram, and a great and darksome hor-\\nror seized upon him.\\n13And it was said unto him: Know thou be-\\nforehand that thy seed shall be a stranger in a\\nland not their own, and they shall bring them\\nunder bondage, and a\\x0fict them four hundred\\nyears.\\n14But I will judge the nation which they shall\\nserve, and after this they shall come out with\\ngreat substance.\\n15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace,\\nand be buried in a good old age.16But in the fourth generation they shall re-\\nturn hither: for as yet the iniquities of the Amor-\\nrhites are not at the full until this present time.\\n17And when the sun was set, there arose a\\ndark mist, and there appeared a smoking fur-\\nnace, and a lamp of \\x0cre passing between those\\ndivisions.\\n18That day God made a covenant with\\nAbram, saying: To thy seed will I give this land,\\nfrom the river to Egypt even to the great river\\nEuphrates.\\n19The Cineans, and Cenezites, the Ced-\\nmonites,\\n20And the Hethites, and the Pherezites, the\\nRaphaim also,\\n21And the Amorrhites, and the Chanaanites,\\nand the Gergesites, and the Jebusites.\\nChapter 16\\nNow Sarai, the wife of Abram, had brought forth\\nno children: but having a handmaid, an Egyp-\\ntian, named Agar,\\n2She said to her husband: Behold, the Lord\\nhath restrained me from bearing: go in unto my\\nhandmaid, it may be I may have children of her\\nat least. And when he agreed to her request,\\n3She took Agar the Egyptian her handmaid,\\nten years after they \\x0crst dwelt in the land of\\nChanaan, and gave her to her husband to wife.\\n4And he went in to her. But she perceiving\\nthat she was with child, despised her mistress.\\n5And Sarai said to Abram: Thou dost un-\\njustly with me: I gave my handmaid into thy bo-\\nsom, and she perceiving herself to be with child,\\ndespiseth me. The Lord judge between me and\\nthee.\\n6And Abram made answer, and said to her:\\nBehold thy handmaid is in thy own hand, use\\nher as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai a\\x0ficted\\nher, she ran away.\\n7And the angel of the Lord having found her,\\nby a fountain of water in the wilderness, which\\nis in the way to Sur in the desert,\\n8He said to her: Agar, handmaid of Sarai,\\nwhence comest thou? and whither goest thou?\\nAnd she answered: I \\ree from the face of Sarai,\\nmy mistress.\\n9And the angel of the Lord said to her: Re-\\nturn to thy mistress, and humble thyself under\\nher hand.\\n10And again he said: I will multiply thy seed\\nexceedingly, and it shall not be numbered for\\nmultitude.\\n11And again: Behold, said he, thou art with\\nchild, and thou shalt bring forth a son: and thou\\nshalt call his name Ismael, because the Lord hath\\nheard thy a\\x0fiction.\\n12He shall be a wild man: his hand will be\\nagainst all men, and all men's hands against him:\\nand he shall pitch his tents over against all his\\nbrethren.\\n13And she called the name of the Lord that\\nspoke unto her: Thou the God who hast seen\\nme. For she said: Verily, here have I seen the\\nhinder parts of him that seeth me.\\n14Therefore she called that well, the well of\\nhim that liveth and seeth me. The same is be-\\ntween Cades and Barad.\\n15And Agar brought forth a son to Abram:\\nwho called his name Ismael.\\n16Abram was four score and six years old\\nwhen Agar brought him forth Ismael.\\nChapter 17\\nAnd after he began to be ninety and nine years\\nold, the Lord appeared to him: and said untohim: I am the Almighty God: walk before me,\\nand be perfect.\\n2And I will make my covenant between me\\nand thee: and I will multiply thee exceedingly.\\n3Abram fell \\rat on his face.\\n4And God said to him: I am, and my\\ncovenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a fa-\\nther of many nations.\\n5Neither shall thy name be called any more\\nAbram: but thou shalt be called Abraham: be-\\ncause I have made thee a father of many nations.\\n6And I will make thee increase exceedingly,\\nand I will make nations of thee, and kings shall\\ncome out of thee.\\n7And I will establish my covenant between\\nme and thee, and between thy seed after thee in\\ntheir generations, by a perpetual covenant: to\\nbe a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee.\\n8And I will give to thee, and to thy seed,\\nthe land of thy sojournment, all the land of\\nChanaan, for a perpetual possession, and I will\\nbe their God.\\n9Again God said to Abraham: And thou\\ntherefore shalt keep my covenant, and thy seed\\nafter thee in their generations.\\n10This is my covenant which you shall ob-\\nserve between me and you, and thy seed after\\nthee: All the male kind of you shall be circum-\\ncised.\\n11And you shall circumcise the \\resh of your\\nforeskin, that it may be for a sign of the covenant\\nbetween me and you.\\n12An infant of eight days old shall be circum-\\ncised among you, every manchild in your genera-\\ntions: he that is born in the house, as well as the\\nbought servant, shall be circumcised, and whoso-\\never is not of your stock:\\n13And my covenant shall be in your \\resh for\\na perpetual covenant.\\n14The male whose \\resh of his foreskin shall\\nnot be circumcised, that soul shall be destroyed\\nout of his people: because he hath broken my\\ncovenant.\\n15God said also to Abraham: Sarai thy wife\\nthou shalt not call Sarai, but Sara.\\n16And I will bless her, and of her I will give\\nthee a son, whom I will bless, and he shall be-\\ncome nations, and kings of people shall spring\\nfrom him.\\n17Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed,\\nsaying in his heart: Shall a son, thinkest thou,\\nbe born to him that is a hundred years old? and\\nshall Sara that is ninety years old bring forth?\\n18And he said to God: O that Ismael may\\nlive before thee.\\n19And God said to Abraham: Sara thy wife\\nshall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his\\nname Isaac, and I will establish my covenant\\nwith him for a perpetual covenant, and with his\\nseed after him.\\n20And as for Ismael I have also heard thee.\\nBehold, I will bless him, and increase, and multi-\\nply him exceedingly: he shall beget twelve chiefs,\\nand I will make him a great nation.\\n21But my covenant I will establish with Isaac,\\nwhom Sara shall bring forth to thee at this time\\nin the next year.\\n22And when he had left o\\x0b speaking with\\nhim, God went up from Abraham.\\n23And Abraham took Ismael his son, and\\nall that were born in his house: and all whom\\nhe had bought, every male among the men of\\nhis house: and he circumcised the \\resh of their\\nforeskin forthwith the very same day, as God had\\ncommanded him.\\n24Abraham was ninety and nine years old,\\nwhen he circumcised the \\resh of his foreskin.\\n25And Ismael his son was full thirteen years\\nold at the time of his circumcision.26The selfsame day was Abraham circum-\\ncised and Ismael his son.\\n27And all the men of his house, as well they\\nthat were born in his house, as the bought ser-\\nvants and strangers, were circumcised with him.\\nChapter 18\\nAnd the Lord appeared to him in the vale of\\nMambre as he was sitting at the door of his tent,\\nin the very heat of the day.\\n2And when he had lifted up his eyes, there\\nappeared to him three men standing near to him:\\nand as soon as he saw them, he ran to meet them\\nfrom the door of his tent, and adored down to\\nthe ground.\\n3And he said: Lord, if I have found favour in\\nthy sight, pass not away from thy servant.\\n4But I will fetch a little water, and wash ye\\nyour feet, and rest ye under the tree.\\n5And I will set a morsel of bread, and\\nstrengthen ye your heart, afterwards you shall\\npass on: for therefore are you come aside to your\\nservant. And they said: Do as thou hast spoken.\\n6Abraham made haste into the tent to Sara,\\nand said to her: Make haste, temper together\\nthree measures of \\rour, and make cakes upon\\nthe hearth.\\n7And he himself ran to the herd, and took\\nfrom thence a calf, very tender and very good,\\nand gave it to a young man, who made haste and\\nboiled it.\\n8He took also butter and milk, and the calf\\nwhich he had boiled, and set before them: but\\nhe stood by them under the tree.\\n9And when they had eaten, they said to him:\\nWhere is Sara thy wife? He answered: Lo she is\\nin the tent.\\n10And he said to him: I will return and come\\nto thee at this time, life accompanying, and Sara,\\nthy wife, shall have a son. Which when Sara\\nheard, she laughed behind the door of the tent.\\n11Now they were both old, and far advanced\\nin years, and it had ceased to be with Sara after\\nthe manner of women.\\n12And she laughed secretly, saying: After I\\nam grown old, and my lord is an old man, shall\\nI give myself to pleasure?\\n13And the Lord said to Abraham: Why did\\nSara laugh, saying: Shall I, who am an old\\nwoman, bear a child indeed?\\n14Is there any thing hard to God? According\\nto appointment I will return to thee at this same\\ntime, life accompanying, and Sara shall have a\\nson.\\n15Sara denied, saying: I did not laugh: for\\nshe was afraid. But the Lord said: Nay; but thou\\ndidst laugh.\\n16And when the men rose up from thence,\\nthey turned their eyes towards Sodom: and\\nAbraham walked with them, bringing them on\\nthe way.\\n17And the Lord said: Can I hide from Abra-\\nham what I am about to do:\\n18Seeing he shall become a great and mighty\\nnation, and in him all the nations of the earth\\nshall be blessed?\\n19For I know that he will command his chil-\\ndren, and his household after him, to keep the\\nway of the Lord, and do judgment and justice:\\nthat for Abraham's sake, the Lord may bring to\\ne\\x0bect all the things he hath spoken unto him.\\n20And the Lord said: The cry of Sodom and\\nGomorrha is multiplied, and their sin is become\\nexceedingly grievous.\\n21I will go down and see whether they have\\ndone according to the cry that is come to me; or\\nwhether it be not so, that I may know.\\n22And they turned themselves from thence,and went their way to Sodom: but Abraham as\\nyet stood before the Lord.\\n23And drawing nigh, he said: Wilt thou de-\\nstroy the just with the wicked?\\n24If there be \\x0cfty just men in the city, shall\\nthey perish withal? and wilt thou not spare that\\nplace for the sake of the \\x0cfty just, if they be\\ntherein?\\n25Far be it from thee to do this thing, and to\\nslay the just with the wicked, and for the just to\\nbe in like case as the wicked; this is not beseem-\\ning thee: thou who judgest all the earth, wilt not\\nmake this judgment.\\n26And the Lord said to him: If I \\x0cnd in\\nSodom \\x0cfty just within the city, I will spare the\\nwhole place for their sake.\\n27And Abraham answered, and said: See-\\ning I have once begun, I will speak to my Lord,\\nwhereas I am dust and ashes.\\n28What if there be \\x0cve less than \\x0cfty just\\npersons? wilt thou for \\x0cve and forty destroy the\\nwhole city: And he said: I will not destroy it, if\\nI \\x0cnd \\x0cve and forty.\\n29And again he said to him: But if forty be\\nfound there, what wilt thou do? He said: I will\\nnot destroy it for the sake of forty.\\n30Lord, saith he, be not angry, I beseech thee,\\nif I speak: What if thirty shall be found there?\\nHe answered: I will not do it, if I \\x0cnd thirty\\nthere.\\n31Seeing, saith he, I have once begun, I will\\nspeak to my Lord: What if twenty be found\\nthere? He said: I will not destroy it for the sake\\nof twenty.\\n32I beseech thee, saith he, be not angry, Lord,\\nif I speak yet once more: What if ten shall be\\nfound there? And he said: I will not destroy it\\nfor the sake of ten.\\n33And the Lord departed, after he had left\\nspeaking to Abraham: and Abraham returned\\nto his place.\\nChapter 19\\nAnd the two angels came to Sodom in the\\nevening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of the\\ncity. And seeing them, he rose up and went\\nto meet them: and worshipped prostrate to the\\nground.\\n2And said: I beseech you, my lords, turn in\\nto the house of your servant, and lodge there:\\nwash your feet, and in the morning you shall go\\non your way. And they said: No, but we will\\nabide in the street.\\n3He pressed them very much to turn in unto\\nhim: and when they were come into his house, he\\nmade them a feast, and baked unleavened bread,\\nand they ate:\\n4But before they went to bed, the men of the\\ncity beset the house, both young and old, all the\\npeople together.\\n5And they called Lot, and said to him: Where\\nare the men that came in to thee at night? bring\\nthem out hither, that we may know them:\\n6Lot went out to them, and shut the door\\nafter him, and said:\\n7Do not so, I beseech you, my brethren, do\\nnot commit this evil.\\n8I have two daughters who, as yet, have not\\nknown man; I will bring them out to you, and\\nabuse you them as it shall please you, so that\\nyou do no evil to these men, because they are\\ncome in under the shadow of my roof.\\n9But they said: Get thee back thither. And\\nagain: Thou camest in, said they, as a stranger,\\nwas it to be a judge? therefore we will a\\x0fict\\nthee more than them. And they pressed very\\nviolently upon Lot: and they were even at the\\npoint of breaking open the doors.10And behold the men put out their hand,\\nand drew in Lot unto them, and shut the door.\\n11And them, that were without, they struck\\nwith blindness from the least to the greatest, so\\nthat they could not \\x0cnd the door.\\n12And they said to Lot: Hast thou here any\\nof thine? son in law, or sons, or daughters, all\\nthat are thine bring them out of this city:\\n13For we will destroy this place, because their\\ncry is grown loud before the Lord, who hath sent\\nus to destroy them.\\n14So Lot went out, and spoke to his sons\\nin law that were to have his daughters, and said:\\nArise: get you out of this place, because the Lord\\nwill destroy this city. And he seemed to them to\\nspeak as it were in jest.\\n15And when it was morning, the angels\\npressed him, saying: Arise, take thy wife, and\\nthe two daughters that thou hast: lest thou also\\nperish in the wickedness of the city.\\n16And as he lingered, they took his hand, and\\nthe hand of his wife, and of his two daughters,\\nbecause the Lord spared him.\\n17And they brought him forth, and set him\\nwithout the city: and there they spoke to him,\\nsaying: Save thy life: look not back, neither stay\\nthou in all the country about: but save thy self\\nin the mountain, lest thou be also consumed.\\n18And Lot said to them: I beseech thee, my\\nLord,\\n19Because thy servant hath found grace be-\\nfore thee, and thou hast magni\\x0ced thy mercy,\\nwhich thou hast shewn to me, in saving my life,\\nand I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some\\nevil seize me, and I die.\\n20There is this city here at hand, to which I\\nmay \\ree, it is a little one, and I shall be saved in\\nit: is it not a little one, and my soul shall live?\\n21And he said to him: Behold also in this, I\\nhave heard thy prayers, not to destroy the city\\nfor which thou hast spoken.\\n22Make haste, and be saved there: because\\nI cannot do any thing till thou go in thither.\\nTherefore the name of that city was called Segor.\\n23The sun was risen upon the earth, and Lot\\nentered into Segor.\\n24And the Lord rained upon Sodom and Go-\\nmorrha brimstone and \\x0cre from the Lord out of\\nheaven.\\n25And he destroyed these cities, and all the\\ncountry about, all the inhabitants of the cities,\\nand all things that spring from the earth.\\n26And his wife looking behind her, was\\nturned into a statue of salt.\\n27And Abraham got up early in the morning,\\nand in the place where he had stood before with\\nthe Lord:\\n28He looked towards Sodom and Gomorrha,\\nand the whole land of that country: and he saw\\nthe ashes rise up from the earth as the smoke of\\na furnace.\\n29Now when God destroyed the cities of that\\ncountry, remembering Abraham, he delivered\\nLot out of the destruction of the cities wherein\\nhe had dwelt.\\n30And Lot went up out of Segor, and abode\\nin the mountain, and his two daughters with him\\n(for he was afraid to stay in Segor) and he dwelt\\nin a cave, he and his two daughters with him.\\n31And the elder said to the younger: Our\\nfather is old, and there is no man left on the\\nearth, to come in unto us after the manner of\\nthe whole earth.\\n32Come, let us make him drunk with wine,\\nand let us lie with him, that we may preserve\\nseed of our father.\\n33And they made their father drink wine that\\nnight: and the elder went in, and lay with her\\nfather: but he perceived not, neither when his\\ndaughter lay down, nor when she rose up.34And the next day the elder said to the\\nyounger: Behold I lay last night with my father,\\nlet us make him drink wine also to night, and\\nthou shalt lie with him, that we may save seed\\nof our father.\\n35They made their father drink wine that\\nnight also, and the younger daughter went in,\\nand lay with him: and neither then did he per-\\nceive when she lay down, nor when she rose up.\\n36So the two daughters of Lot were with child\\nby their father.\\n37And the elder bore a son, and she called\\nhis name Moab: he is the father of the Moabites\\nunto this day.\\n38The younger also bore a son, and she called\\nhis name Ammon; that is, the son of my people:\\nhe is the father of the Ammonites unto this day.\\nChapter 20\\nAbraham removed from thence to the south\\ncountry, and dwelt between Cades and Sur, and\\nsojourned in Gerara.\\n2And he said of Sara his wife: She is my sister.\\nSo Abimelech the king of Gerara sent, and took\\nher.\\n3And God came to Abimelech in a dream by\\nnight, and he said to him: Lo thou shalt die for\\nthe woman that thou hast taken: for she hath a\\nhusband.\\n4Now Abimelech had not touched her, and\\nhe said: Lord, wilt thou slay a nation that is\\nignorant and just?\\n5Did not he say to me: She is my sister: and\\nshe say, He is my brother? in the simplicity of\\nmy heart, and cleanness of my hands have I done\\nthis.\\n6And God said to him: And I know that\\nthou didst it with a sincere heart: and therefore\\nI withheld thee from sinning against me, and I\\nsu\\x0bered thee not to touch her.\\n7Now therefore restore the man his wife, for\\nhe is a prophet: and he shall pray for thee, and\\nthou shalt live: but if thou wilt not restore her,\\nknow that thou shalt surely die, thou and all\\nthat are thine.\\n8And Abimelech forthwith rising up in the\\nnight, called all his servants: and spoke all these\\nwords in their hearing, and all the men were ex-\\nceedingly afraid.\\n9And Abimelech called also for Abraham, and\\nsaid to him: What hast thou done to us? what\\nhave we o\\x0bended thee in, that thou hast brought\\nupon me and upon my kingdom a great sin?\\nthou hast done to us what thou oughtest not\\nto do.\\n10And again he expostulated with him, and\\nsaid: What sawest thou, that thou hast done\\nthis?\\n11Abraham answered: I thought with myself,\\nsaying: Perhaps there is not the fear of God in\\nthis place: and they will kill me for the sake of\\nmy wife:\\n12Howbeit, otherwise also she is truly my\\nsister, the daughter of my father, and not the\\ndaughter of my mother, and I took her to wife.\\n13And after God brought me out of my fa-\\nther's house, I said to her: Thou shalt do me\\nthis kindness: In every place, to which we shall\\ncome, thou shalt say that I am thy brother.\\n14And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and\\nservants and handmaids, and gave to Abraham:\\nand restored to him Sara his wife,\\n15And said: The land is before you, dwell\\nwheresoever it shall please thee.\\n16And to Sara he said: Behold I have given\\nthy brother a thousand pieces of silver, this shall\\nserve thee for a covering of thy eyes to all that\\nare with thee, and whithersoever thou shalt go:and remember thou wast taken.\\n17And when Abraham prayed, God healed\\nAbimelech and his wife, and his handmaids, and\\nthey bore children:\\n18For the Lord had closed up every womb\\nof the house of Abimelech, on account of Sara,\\nAbraham's wife.\\nChapter 21\\nAnd the Lord visited Sara, as he had promised:\\nand ful\\x0clled what he had spoken.\\n2And she conceived and bore a son in her old\\nage, at the time that God had foretold her.\\n3And Abraham called the name of his son,\\nwhom Sara bore him, Isaac.\\n4And he circumcised him the eighth day, as\\nGod had commanded him,\\n5When he was a hundred years old: for at\\nthis age of his father, was Isaac born.\\n6And Sara said: God hath made a laughter\\nfor me: whosoever shall hear of it will laugh with\\nme.\\n7And again she said: Who would believe that\\nAbraham should hear that Sara gave suck to a\\nson, whom she bore to him in his old age?\\n8And the child grew, and was weaned: and\\nAbraham made a great feast on the day of his\\nweaning.\\n9And when Sara had seen the son of Agar,\\nthe Egyptian, playing with Isaac, her son, she\\nsaid to Abraham:\\n10Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for\\nthe son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with\\nmy son Isaac.\\n11Abraham took this grievously for his son.\\n12And God said to him: Let it not seem\\ngrievous to thee for the boy, and for thy bond-\\nwoman: in all that Sara hath said to thee, hear-\\nken to her voice: for in Isaac shall thy seed be\\ncalled.\\n13But I will make the son also of the bond-\\nwoman a great nation, because he is thy seed.\\n14So Abraham rose up in the morning, and\\ntaking bread and a bottle of water, put it upon\\nher shoulder, and delivered the boy, and sent her\\naway. And she departed, and wandered in the\\nwilderness of Bersabee.\\n15And when the water in the bottle was\\nspent, she cast the boy under one of the trees\\nthat were there.\\n16And she went her way, and sat overagainst\\nhim a great way o\\x0b, as far as a bow can carry, for\\nshe said: I will not see the boy die: and sitting\\noveragainst, she lifted up her voice and wept.\\n17And God heard the voice of the boy: and\\nan angel of God called to Agar from heaven, say-\\ning: What art thou doing, Agar? fear not; for\\nGod hath heard the voice of the boy, from the\\nplace wherein he is.\\n18Arise, take up the boy, and hold him by\\nthe hand, for I will make him a great nation.\\n19And God opened her eyes: and she saw a\\nwell of water, and went and \\x0clled the bottle, and\\ngave the boy to drink.\\n20And God was with him: and he grew, and\\ndwelt in the wilderness, and became a young\\nman, an archer.\\n21And he dwelt in the wilderness of Pharan,\\nand his mother took a wife for him out of the\\nland of Egypt.\\n22At the same time Abimelech, and Phicol\\nthe general of his army, said to Abraham: God\\nis with thee in all that thou dost.\\n23Swear therefore by God, that thou wilt not\\nhurt me, nor my posterity, nor my stock: but ac-\\ncording to the kindness that I have done to thee,\\nthou shalt do to me, and to the land wherein\\nthou hast lived a stranger.24And Abraham said: I will swear.\\n25And he reproved Abimelech for a well of\\nwater, which his servants had taken away by\\nforce.\\n26And Abimelech answered: I knew not who\\ndid this thing: and thou didst not tell me, and I\\nheard not of it till today.\\n27Then Abraham took sheep and oxen, and\\ngave them to Abimelech: and both of them made\\na league.\\n28And Abraham set apart seven ewelambs of\\nthe \\rock.\\n29And Abimelech said to him: What mean\\nthese seven ewelambs which thou hast set apart?\\n30But he said: Thou shalt take seven ewe-\\nlambs at my hand: that they may be a testimony\\nfor me, that I dug this well.\\n31Therefore that place was called Bersabee;\\nbecause there both of them did swear.\\n32And they made a league for the well of\\noath.\\n33And Abimelech and Phicol, the general\\nof his army, arose and returned to the land of\\nthe Palestines. But Abraham planted a grove in\\nBersabee, and there called upon the name of the\\nLord God eternal.\\n34And he was a sojourner in the land of the\\nPalestines many days.\\nChapter 22\\nAfter these things, God tempted Abraham, and\\nsaid to him: Abraham, Abraham. And he an-\\nswered: Here I am.\\n2He said to him: Take thy only begotten son\\nIsaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land\\nof vision; and there thou shalt o\\x0ber him for an\\nholocaust upon one of the mountains which I will\\nshew thee.\\n3So Abraham rising up in the night, saddled\\nhis ass, and took with him two young men, and\\nIsaac his son: and when he had cut wood for the\\nholocaust, he went his way to the place which\\nGod had commanded him.\\n4And on the third day, lifting up his eyes, he\\nsaw the place afar o\\x0b.\\n5And he said to his young men: Stay you here\\nwith the ass; I and the boy will go with speed\\nas far as yonder, and after we have worshipped,\\nwill return to you.\\n6And he took the wood for the holocaust, and\\nlaid it upon Isaac his son; and he himself carried\\nin his hands \\x0cre and a sword. And as they two\\nwent on together,\\n7Isaac said to his father: My father. And he\\nanswered: What wilt thou, son? Behold, saith\\nhe, \\x0cre and wood: where is the victim for the\\nholocaust?\\n8And Abraham said: God will provide him-\\nself a victim for an holocaust, my son. So they\\nwent on together.\\n9And they came to the place which God had\\nshewn him, where he built an altar, and laid the\\nwood in order upon it; and when he had bound\\nIsaac his son, he laid him on the altar upon the\\npile of wood.\\n10And he put forth his hand, and took the\\nsword, to sacri\\x0cce his son.\\n11And behold, an angel of the Lord from\\nheaven called to him, saying: Abraham, Abra-\\nham. And he answered: Here I am.\\n12And he said to him: Lay not thy hand upon\\nthe boy, neither do thou any thing to him: now I\\nknow that thou fearest God, and hast not spared\\nthy only begotten son for my sake.\\n13Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw behind\\nhis back a ram, amongst the briers, sticking fast\\nby the horns, which he took and o\\x0bered for a\\nholocaust instead of his son.14And he called the name of that place, The\\nLord seeth. Whereupon, even to this day, it is\\nsaid: In the mountain the Lord will see.\\n15And the angel of the Lord called to Abra-\\nham a second time from heaven, saying:\\n16By my own self have I sworn, saith the\\nLord: because thou hast done this thing, and\\nhast not spared thy only begotten son for my\\nsake:\\n17I will bless thee, and I will multiply thy\\nseed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that\\nis by the sea shore; thy seed shall possess the\\ngates of their enemies.\\n18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the\\nearth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed my\\nvoice.\\n19Abraham returned to his young men, and\\nthey went to Bersabee together, and he dwelt\\nthere.\\n20After these things, it was told Abraham,\\nthat Melcha also had borne children to Nachor\\nhis brother.\\n21Hus, the \\x0crstborn, and Buz, his brother,\\nand Camuel the father of the Syrians,\\n22And Cased, and Azau, and Pheldas, and\\nJedlaph,\\n23And Bathuel, of whom was born Rebecca:\\nthese eight did Melcha bear to Nachor, Abra-\\nham's brother.\\n24And his concubine, named Roma, bore\\nTabee, and Gaham, and Tahas, and Maacha.\\nChapter 23\\nAnd Sara lived a hundred and twenty-seven\\nyears.\\n2And she died in the city of Arbee which is\\nHebron, in the land of Chanaan: and Abraham\\ncame to mourn and weep for her.\\n3And after he rose up from the funeral obse-\\nquies, he spoke to the children of Heth, saying:\\n4I am a stranger and sojourner among you:\\ngive me the right of a burying place with you,\\nthat I may bury my dead.\\n5The children of Heth answered, saying:\\n6My lord, hear us, thou art a prince of God\\namong us: bury thy dead in our principal sepul-\\nchres: and no man shall have power to hinder\\nthee from burying thy dead in his sepulchre.\\n7Abraham rose up, and bowed down to the\\npeople of the land, to wit, the children of Heth:\\n8And said to them: If it please your soul that\\nI should bury my dead, hear me, and intercede\\nfor me to Ephron the son of Seor.\\n9That he may give me the double cave, which\\nhe hath in the end of his \\x0celd: For as much\\nmoney as it is worth he shall give it me before\\nyou, for a possession of a burying place.\\n10Now Ephron dwelt in the midst of the\\nchildren of Heth. And Ephron made answer to\\nAbraham in the hearing of all that went in at\\nthe gate of the city, saying:\\n11Let it not be so, my lord, but do thou\\nrather hearken to what I say: The \\x0celd I de-\\nliver to thee, and the cave that is therein; in the\\npresence of the children of my people, bury thy\\ndead.\\n12Abraham bowed down before the people of\\nthe land.\\n13And he spoke to Ephron, in the presence\\nof the people: I beseech thee to hear me: I will\\ngive money for the \\x0celd; take it, and so will I\\nbury my dead in it.\\n14And Ephron answered:\\n15My lord, hear me. The ground which thou\\ndesirest, is worth four hundred sicles of silver:\\nthis is the price between me and thee: but what\\nis this? bury thy dead.16And when Abraham had heard this, he\\nweighed out the money that Ephron had asked,\\nin the hearing of the children of Heth, four hun-\\ndred sicles of silver, of common current money.\\n17And the \\x0celd that before was Ephron's,\\nwherein was the double cave, looking towards\\nMambre, both it and the cave, and all the trees\\nthereof, in all its limits round about,\\n18Was made sure to Abraham for a posses-\\nsion, in the sight of the children of Heth, and of\\nall that went in at the gate of his city.\\n19And so Abraham buried Sara, his wife, in\\nthe double cave of the \\x0celd, that looked towards\\nMambre, this is Hebron in the land of Chanaan.\\n20And the \\x0celd was made sure to Abraham,\\nand the cave that was in it, for a possession to\\nbury in, by the children of Heth.\\nChapter 24\\nNow Abraham was old, and advanced in age; and\\nthe Lord had blessed him in all things.\\n2And he said to the elder servant of his house,\\nwho was ruler over all he had: Put thy hand\\nunder my thigh,\\n3That I may make thee swear by the Lord, the\\nGod of heaven and earth, that thou take not a\\nwife for my son, of the daughters of the Chanaan-\\nites, among whom I dwell:\\n4But that thou go to my own country and\\nkindred, and take a wife from thence for my son\\nIsaac.\\n5The servant answered: If the woman will not\\ncome with me into this land, must I bring thy son\\nback again to the place from whence thou camest\\nout?\\n6And Abraham said: Beware thou never\\nbring my son back again thither.\\n7The Lord God of heaven, who took me out\\nof my father's house, and out of my native coun-\\ntry, who spoke to me, and swore to me, saying:\\nTo thy seed will I give this land: he will send\\nhis angel before thee, and thou shalt take from\\nthence a wife for my son.\\n8But if the woman will not follow thee, thou\\nshalt not be bound by the oath: only bring not\\nmy son back thither again.\\n9The servant, therefore, put his hand under\\nthe thigh of Abraham, his lord, and swore to him\\nupon his word.\\n10And he took ten camels of his master's\\nherd, and departed, carrying something of all his\\ngoods with him, and he set forward and went on\\nto Mesopotamia, to the city of Nachor.\\n11And when he had made the camels lie down\\nwithout the town, near a well of water, in the\\nevening, at the time when women are wont to\\ncome out to draw water, he said:\\n12O Lord, the God of my master, Abraham,\\nmeet me today, I beseech thee, and shew kind-\\nness to my master, Abraham.\\n13Behold, I stand nigh the spring of water,\\nand the daughters of the inhabitants of this city\\nwill come out to draw water:\\n14Now, therefore, the maid to whom I shall\\nsay: Let down thy pitcher that I may drink:\\nand she shall answer, Drink, and I will give thy\\ncamels drink also: let it be the same whom thou\\nhast provided for thy servant Isaac: and by this,\\nI shall understand that thou hast shewn kindness\\nto my master.\\n15He had not yet ended these words within\\nhimself, and behold Rebecca came out, the\\ndaughter of Bathuel, son of Melcha, wife to Na-\\nchor the brother of Abraham, having a pitcher\\non her shoulder:\\n16An exceeding comely maid, and a most\\nbeautiful virgin, and not known to man: and she\\nwent down to the spring, and \\x0clled her pitcher,and was coming back.\\n17And the servant ran to meet her, and said:\\nGive me a little water to drink of thy pitcher.\\n18And she answered: Drink, my lord. And\\nquickly she let down the pitcher upon her arm,\\nand gave him drink.\\n19And when he had drunk, she said: I will\\ndraw water for thy camels also, till they all drink.\\n20And pouring out the pitcher into the\\ntroughs, she ran back to the well to draw water;\\nand having drawn, she gave to all the camels.\\n21But he musing, beheld her with silence,\\ndesirous to know whether the Lord had made\\nhis journey prosperous or not.\\n22And after that the camels had drunk, the\\nman took out golden earrings, weighing two\\nsicles; and as many bracelets, of ten sicles weight.\\n23And he said to her: Whose daughter art\\nthou? tell me: is there any place in thy father's\\nhouse to lodge?\\n24And she answered: I am the daughter of\\nBathuel, the son of Melcha, whom she bore to\\nNachor.\\n25And she said, moreover, to him: We have\\ngood store of both straw and hay, and a large\\nplace to lodge in.\\n26The man bowed himself down, and adored\\nthe Lord,\\n27Saying: Blessed be the Lord God of my\\nmaster Abraham, who hath not taken away his\\nmercy and truth from my master, and hath\\nbrought me the straight way into the house of\\nmy master's brother.\\n28Then the maid ran, and told in her\\nmother's house all that she had heard.\\n29And Rebecca had a brother, named Laban,\\nwho went out in haste to the man, to the well.\\n30And when he had seen the earrings and\\nbracelets in his sister's hands, and had heard all\\nthat she related, saying, Thus and thus the man\\nspoke to me: he came to the man who stood by\\nthe camels, and near to the spring of water,\\n31And said to him: Come in, thou blessed\\nof the Lord; why standest thou without? I have\\nprepared the house, and a place for the camels.\\n32And he brought him into his lodging; and\\nhe unharnessed the camels, and gave straw and\\nhay, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of\\nthe men that were come with him.\\n33And bread was set before him. But he said:\\nI will not eat, till I tell my message. He answered\\nhim: Speak.\\n34And he said: I am the servant of Abraham:\\n35And the Lord hath blessed my master won-\\nderfully, and he is become great: and he hath\\ngiven him sheep and oxen, silver and gold, men\\nservants and women servants, camels and asses.\\n36And Sara, my master's wife, hath borne my\\nmaster a son in her old age, and he hath given\\nhim all that he had.\\n37And my master made me swear, saying:\\nThou shalt not take a wife for my son of the\\nChanaanites, in whose land I dwell:\\n38But thou shalt go to my father's house, and\\nshalt take a wife of my own kindred for my son:\\n39But I answered my master: What if the\\nwoman will not come with me?\\n40The Lord, said he, in whose sight I walk,\\nwill send his angel with thee, and will direct thy\\nway: and thou shalt take a wife for my son of\\nmy own kindred, and of my father's house.\\n41But thou shalt be clear from my curse,\\nwhen thou shalt come to my kindred, if they will\\nnot give thee one.\\n42And I came today to the well of water,\\nand said: O Lord God of my master, Abraham,\\nif thou hast prospered my way, wherein I now\\nwalk,\\n43Behold, I stand by the well of water, and\\nthe virgin, that shall come out to draw water,who shall hear me say: Give me a little water to\\ndrink of thy pitcher:\\n44And shall say to me: Both drink thou, and\\nI will also draw for thy camels: let the same be\\nthe woman, whom the Lord hath prepared for\\nmy master's son.\\n45And whilst I pondered these things secretly\\nwith myself, Rebecca appeared, coming with a\\npitcher, which she carried on her shoulder: and\\nshe went down to the well and drew water. And\\nI said to her: Give me a little to drink.\\n46And she speedily let down the pitcher from\\nher shoulder, and said to me: Both drink thou,\\nand to thy camels I will give drink. I drank, and\\nshe watered the camels.\\n47And I asked her, and said: Whose daughter\\nart thou? And she answered: I am the daugh-\\nter of Bathuel, the son of Nachor, whom Melcha\\nbore to him. So I put earrings on her to adorn\\nher face, and I put bracelets on her hands.\\n48And falling down, I adored the Lord, bless-\\ning the Lord God of my master, Abraham, who\\nhath brought me the straight way to take the\\ndaughter of my master's brother for his son.\\n49Wherefore, if you do according to mercy\\nand truth with my master, tell me: but if it\\nplease you otherwise, tell me that also, that I\\nmay go to the right hand, or to the left.\\n50And Laban and Bathuel answered: The\\nword hath proceeded from the Lord: we cannot\\nspeak any other thing to thee but his pleasure.\\n51Behold, Rebecca is before thee, take her\\nand go thy way, and let her be the wife of thy\\nmaster's son, as the Lord hath spoken.\\n52Which when Abraham's servant heard,\\nfalling down to the ground, he adored the Lord.\\n53And bringing forth vessels of silver and\\ngold, and garments, he gave them to Rebecca,\\nfor a present. He o\\x0bered gifts also to her broth-\\ners, and to her mother.\\n54And a banquet was made, and they ate\\nand drank together, and lodged there. And in\\nthe morning, the servant arose, and said: Let\\nme depart, that I may go to my master.\\n55And her brother and mother answered: Let\\nthe maid stay, at least, ten days with us, and\\nafterwards she shall depart.\\n56Stay me not, said he, because the Lord\\nhath prospered my way: send me away, that I\\nmay go to my master.\\n57And they said: Let us call the maid, and\\nask her will.\\n58And they called her, and when she was\\ncome, they asked: Wilt thou go with this man?\\nShe said: I will go.\\n59So they sent her away, and her nurse, and\\nAbraham's servant, and his company.\\n60Wishing prosperity to their sister, and say-\\ning: Thou art our sister, mayst thou increase to\\nthousands of thousands; and may thy seed pos-\\nsess the gates of their enemies.\\n61So Rebecca and her maids, being set upon\\ncamels, followed the man: who with speed re-\\nturned to his master.\\n62At the same time, Isaac was walking along\\nthe way to the well which is called Of the living\\nand the seeing: for he dwelt in the south country:\\n63And he was gone forth to meditate in the\\n\\x0celd, the day being now well spent: and when\\nhe had lifted up his eyes, he saw camels coming\\nafar o\\x0b.\\n64Rebecca also, when she saw Isaac, lighted\\no\\x0b the camel,\\n65And said to the servant: Who is that man\\nwho cometh towards us along the \\x0celd? And he\\nsaid to her: That man is my master. But she\\nquickly took her cloak, and covered herself.\\n66And the servant told Isaac all that he had\\ndone.67Who brought her into the tent of Sara his\\nmother, and took her to wife: and he loved her\\nso much, that it moderated the sorrow which was\\noccasioned by his mother's death.\\nChapter 25\\nAnd Abraham married another wife named Ce-\\ntura:\\n2Who bore him Zamram, and Jecsan, and\\nMadan, and Madian, and Jesboc, and Sue.\\n3Jecsan also begot Saba, and Dadan. The\\nchildren of Dadan were Assurim, and Latusim,\\nand Loomim.\\n4But of Madian was born Epha, and Opher,\\nand Henoch, and Abida, and Eldaa: all these\\nwere the children of Cetura.\\n5And Abraham gave all his possessions to\\nIsaac:\\n6And to the children of the concubines he\\ngave gifts, and separated them from Isaac his\\nson, while he yet lived, to the east country.\\n7And the days of Abraham's life were a hun-\\ndred and seventy-\\x0cve years.\\n8And decaying he died in a good old age, and\\nhaving lived a long time, and being full of days:\\nand was gathered to his people.\\n9And Isaac and Ismael his sons buried him\\nin the double cave, which was situated in the\\n\\x0celd of Ephron the son of Seor the Hethite, over\\nagainst Mambre,\\n10Which he had bought of the children of\\nHeth: there was he buried, and Sara his wife.\\n11And after his death, God blessed Isaac his\\nson, who dwelt by the well named Of the living\\nand seeing.\\n12These are the generations of Ismael the son\\nof Abraham, whom Agar the Egyptian, Sara's\\nservant, bore unto him:\\n13And these are the names of his children\\naccording to their calling and generations. The\\n\\x0crstborn of Ismael was Nabajoth, then Cedar,\\nand Adbeel, and Mabsam,\\n14And Masma, and Duma, and Massa,\\n15Hadar, and Thema, and Jethur, and\\nNaphis, and Cedma.\\n16These are the sons of Ismael: and these are\\ntheir names by their castles and towns, twelve\\nprinces of their tribes.\\n17And the years of Ismael's life were a hun-\\ndred and thirty-seven, and decaying he died, and\\nwas gathered unto his people.\\n18And he dwelt from Hevila as far as Sur,\\nwhich looketh towards Egypt, to them that go\\ntowards the Assyrians. He died in the presence\\nof all his brethren.\\n19These also are the generations of Isaac the\\nson of Abraham: Abraham begot Isaac:\\n20Who when he was forty years old, took to\\nwife Rebecca the daughter of Bathuel the Syrian\\nof Mesopotamia, sister to Laban.\\n21And Isaac besought the Lord for his wife,\\nbecause she was barren: and he heard him, and\\nmade Rebecca to conceive.\\n22But the children struggled in her womb,\\nand she said: If it were to be so with me, what\\nneed was there to conceive? And she went to\\nconsult the Lord.\\n23And he answering, said: Two nations are\\nin thy womb, and two peoples shall be divided\\nout of thy womb, and one people shall overcome\\nthe other, and the elder shall serve the younger.\\n24And when her time was come to be deliv-\\nered, behold twins were found in her womb.\\n25He that came forth \\x0crst was red, and hairy\\nlike a skin: and his name was called Esau. Imme-\\ndiately the other coming forth, held his brother's\\nfoot in his hand: and therefore he was called Ja-\\ncob.26Isaac was threescore years old when the\\nchildren were born unto him.\\n27And when they were grown up, Esau be-\\ncame a skilful hunter, and a husbandman: but\\nJacob, a plain man, dwelt in tents.\\n28Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his\\nhunting: and Rebecca loved Jacob.\\n29And Jacob boiled pottage: to whom Esau,\\ncoming faint out of the \\x0celd,\\n30Said: Give me of this red pottage, for I am\\nexceeding faint. For which reason his name was\\ncalled Edom.\\n31And Jacob said to him: Sell me thy \\x0crst\\nbirthright.\\n32He answered: Lo I die, what will the \\x0crst\\nbirthright avail me?\\n33Jacob said: Swear therefore to me. Esau\\nswore to him, and sold his \\x0crst birthright.\\n34And so taking bread and the pottage of\\nlentils, he ate, and drank, and went on his way;\\nmaking little account of having sold his \\x0crst\\nbirthright.\\nChapter 26\\nAnd when a famine came in the land, after that\\nbarrenness which had happened in the days of\\nAbraham, Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the\\nPalestines, to Gerara.\\n2And the Lord appeared to him, and said:\\nGo not down into Egypt, but stay in the land\\nthat I shall tell thee.\\n3And sojourn in it, and I will be with thee,\\nand will bless thee: for to thee and to thy seed\\nI will give all these countries, to ful\\x0cl the oath\\nwhich I swore to Abraham thy father.\\n4And I will multiply thy seed like the stars of\\nheaven: and I will give to thy posterity all these\\ncountries: and in thy seed shall all the nations\\nof the earth be blessed.\\n5Because Abraham obeyed my voice, and\\nkept my precepts and commandments, and ob-\\nserved my ceremonies and laws.\\n6So Isaac abode in Gerara.\\n7And when he was asked by the men of that\\nplace, concerning his wife, he answered: She is\\nmy sister: for he was afraid to confess that she\\nwas his wife, thinking lest perhaps they would\\nkill him because of her beauty.\\n8And when very many days were passed,\\nand he abode there, Abimelech, king of the\\nPalestines, looking out through a window, saw\\nhim playing with Rebecca, his wife.\\n9And calling for him, he said: It is evident\\nshe is thy wife: why didst thou feign her to be\\nthy sister? He answered: I feared lest I should\\ndie for her sake.\\n10And Abimelech said: Why hast thou de-\\nceived us? Some man of the people might have\\nlain with thy wife, and thou hadst brought upon\\nus a great sin. And he commanded all the peo-\\nple, saying:\\n11He that shall touch this man's wife, shall\\nsurely be put to death.\\n12And Isaac sowed in that land, and he found\\nthat same year a hundredfold: and the Lord\\nblessed him.\\n13And the man was enriched, and he went\\non prospering and increasing, till he became ex-\\nceeding great.\\n14And he had possessions of sheep and of\\nherds, and a very great family. Wherefore the\\nPalestines envying him,\\n15Stopped up at that time all the wells, that\\nthe servants of his father, Abraham, had digged,\\n\\x0clling them up with earth:\\n16Insomuch that Abimelech himself said to\\nIsaac: Depart from us, for thou art become much\\nmightier than we.17So he departed, and came to the torrent of\\nGerara, to dwell there:\\n18And he digged again other wells, which the\\nservants of his father, Abraham, had digged, and\\nwhich, after his death, the Philistines had of old\\nstopped up: and he called them by the same\\nnames, by which his father before had called\\nthem.\\n19And they digged in the torrent, and found\\nliving water:\\n20But there also the herdsmen of Gerara\\nstrove against the herdsmen of Isaac, saying: It is\\nour water. Wherefore he called the name of the\\nwell, on occasion of that which had happened,\\nCalumny.\\n21And they digged also another; and for that\\nthey quarrelled likewise, and he called the name\\nof it, Enmity.\\n22Going forward from thence, he digged an-\\nother well, for which they contended not; there-\\nfore he called the name thereof, Latitude, saying:\\nNow hath the Lord given us room, and made us\\nto increase upon the earth.\\n23And he went up from that place to\\nBersabee,\\n24Where the Lord appeared to him that same\\nnight, saying: I am the God of Abraham thy\\nfather, do not fear, for I am with thee: I will\\nbless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant\\nAbraham's sake.\\n25And he built there an altar: and called\\nupon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent;\\nand commanded his servants to dig a well.\\n26To which place when Abimelech, and\\nOchozath his friend, and Phicol chief captain of\\nhis soldiers, came from Gerara,\\n27Isaac said to them: Why are ye come to\\nme, a man whom you hate, and have thrust out\\nfrom you?\\n28And they answered: We saw that the Lord\\nis with thee, and therefore we said: Let there be\\nan oath between us, and let us make a covenant,\\n29That thou do us no harm, as we on our part\\nhave touched nothing of thine, nor have done any\\nthing to hurt thee; but with peace have sent thee\\naway, increased with the blessing of the Lord.\\n30And he made them a feast, and after they\\nhad eaten and drunk:\\n31Arising in the morning, they swore one to\\nanother: and Isaac sent them away peaceably to\\ntheir own home.\\n32And behold, the same day the servants of\\nIsaac came, telling him of a well which they had\\ndigged, and saying: We have found water.\\n33Whereupon he called it Abundance: and\\nthe name of the city was called Bersabee, even\\nto this day.\\n34And Esau being forty years old, married\\nwives, Judith, the daughter of Beeri, the Hethite,\\nand Basemath, the daughter of Elon, of the same\\nplace.\\n35And they both o\\x0bended the mind of Isaac\\nand Rebecca.\\nChapter 27\\nNow Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, and\\nhe could not see: and he called Esau, his elder\\nson, and said to him: My son? And he answered:\\nHere I am.\\n2And his father said to him, Thou seest that\\nI am old, and know not the day of my death.\\n3Take thy arms, thy quiver, and bow, and go\\nabroad; and when thou hast taken something by\\nhunting,\\n4Make me a savoury meat thereof, as thou\\nknowest I like, and bring it that I may eat: and\\nmy soul may bless thee, before I die.\\n5And when Rebecca had heard this, and hewas gone into the \\x0celd to ful\\x0cl his father's com-\\nmandment,\\n6She said to her son Jacob: I heard thy father\\ntalking with Esau, thy brother, and saying to\\nhim:\\n7Bring me of thy hunting, and make me meats\\nthat I may eat, and bless thee in the sight of the\\nLord, before I die.\\n8Now therefore, my son, follow my counsel:\\n9And go thy way to the \\rock, bring me two\\nkids of the best, that I may make of them meat\\nfor thy father, such as he gladly eateth.\\n10Which when thou hast brought in, and he\\nhath eaten, he may bless thee before he die.\\n11And he answered her: Thou knowest that\\nEsau, my brother, is a hairy man, and I am\\nsmooth:\\n12If my father should feel me, and perceive\\nit, I fear lest he will think I would have mocked\\nhim, and I shall bring upon me a curse instead\\nof a blessing.\\n13And his mother said to him: Upon me be\\nthis curse, my son: only hear thou my voice, and\\ngo, fetch me the things which I have said.\\n14He went, and brought, and gave them to\\nhis mother. She dressed meats, such as she knew\\nhis father liked.\\n15And she put on him very good garments of\\nEsau, which she had at home with her:\\n16And the little skins of the kids she put\\nabout his hands, and covered the bare of his\\nneck.\\n17And she gave him the savoury meat, and\\ndelivered him bread that she had baked.\\n18Which when he had carried in, he said: My\\nfather? But he answered: I hear. Who art thou,\\nmy son?\\n19And Jacob said: I am Esau, thy \\x0crstborn:\\nI have done as thou didst command me: arise, sit\\nand eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless\\nme.\\n20And Isaac said to his son: How couldst\\nthou \\x0cnd it so quickly, my son? He answered:\\nIt was the will of God, that what I sought came\\nquickly in my way:\\n21And Isaac said: Come hither, that I may\\nfeel thee, my son, and may prove whether thou\\nbe my son Esau, or no.\\n22He came near to his father, and when he\\nhad felt him, Isaac said: The voice indeed is the\\nvoice of Jacob; but the hands, are the hands of\\nEsau.\\n23And he knew him not, because his hairy\\nhands made him like to the elder. Then blessing\\nhim,\\n24He said: Art thou my son Esau? He an-\\nswered: I am.\\n25Then he said: Bring me the meats of thy\\nhunting, my son, that my soul may bless thee.\\nAnd when they were brought, and he had eaten,\\nhe o\\x0bered him wine also, which after he had\\ndrunk,\\n26He said to him: Come near me, and give\\nme a kiss, my son.\\n27He came near, and kissed him. And im-\\nmediately as he smelled the fragrant smell of\\nhis garments, blessing him, he said: Behold, the\\nsmell of my son is as the smell of a plentiful \\x0celd,\\nwhich the Lord hath blessed.\\n28God give thee of the dew of heaven, and of\\nthe fatness of the earth, abundance of corn and\\nwine.\\n29And let peoples serve thee, and tribes wor-\\nship thee: be thou lord of thy brethren, and\\nlet thy mother's children bow down before thee.\\nCursed be he that curseth thee: and let him that\\nblesseth thee be \\x0clled with blessings.\\n30Isaac had scarce ended his words, when,\\nJacob being now gone out abroad, Esau came,31And brought in to his father meats, made\\nof what he had taken in hunting, saying: Arise,\\nmy father, and eat of thy son's venison; that thy\\nsoul may bless me.\\n32And Isaac said to him: Why! who art\\nthou? He answered: I am thy \\x0crstborn son,\\nEsau.\\n33Isaac was struck with fear, and astonished\\nexceedingly; and wondering beyond what can be\\nbelieved, said: Who is he then that even now\\nbrought me venison that he had taken, and I ate\\nof all before thou camest? and I have blessed\\nhim, and he shall be blessed.\\n34Esau having heard his father's words,\\nroared out with a great cry; and, being in a con-\\nsternation, said: Bless me also, my father.\\n35And he said: Thy brother came deceitfully\\nand got thy blessing.\\n36But he said again: Rightly is his name\\ncalled Jacob; for he hath supplanted me lo this\\nsecond time: My birthright he took away before,\\nand now this second time he hath stolen away\\nmy blessing. And again he said to his father:\\nHast thou not reserved me also a blessing?\\n37Isaac answered: I have appointed him thy\\nlord, and have made all his brethren his servants:\\nI have established him with corn and wine, and\\nafter this, what shall I do more for thee, my son?\\n38And Esau said to him: Hast thou only one\\nblessing, father? I beseech thee bless me also.\\nAnd when he wept with a loud cry,\\n39Isaac being moved, said to him: In the\\nfat of the earth, and in the dew of heaven from\\nabove,\\n40Shall thy blessing be. Thou shalt live by\\nthe sword, and shalt serve thy brother: and the\\ntime shall come, when thou shalt shake o\\x0b and\\nloose his yoke from thy neck.\\n41Esau therefore always hated Jacob, for the\\nblessing wherewith his father had blessed him;\\nand he said in his heart: The days will come of\\nthe mourning for my father, and I will kill my\\nbrother Jacob.\\n42These things were told to Rebecca: and\\nshe sent and called Jacob, her son, and said to\\nhim: Behold Esau, thy brother, threateneth to\\nkill thee.\\n43Now therefore, my son, hear my voice, arise\\nand \\ree to Laban, my brother, to Haran:\\n44And thou shalt dwell with him a few days,\\ntill the wrath of thy brother be assuaged,\\n45And his indignation cease, and he forget\\nthe things thou hast done to him: afterwards\\nI will send, and bring thee from thence hither.\\nWhy shall I be deprived of both my sons in one\\nday?\\n46And Rebecca said to Isaac: I am weary\\nof my life, because of the daughters of Heth: if\\nJacob take a wife of the stock of this land, I\\nchoose not to live.\\nChapter 28\\nAnd Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and\\ncharged him, saying: Take not a wife of the stock\\nof Chanaan:\\n2But go, and take a journey to Mesopotamia\\nof Syria, to the house of Bathuel, thy mother's\\nfather, and take thee a wife thence of the daugh-\\nters of Laban, thy uncle.\\n3And God almighty bless thee, and make thee\\nto increase and multiply thee: that thou mayst\\nbe a multitude of people.\\n4And give the blessings of Araham to thee,\\nand to thy seed after thee: that thou mayst\\npossess the land of thy sojournment, which he\\npromised to thy grandfather.\\n5And when Isaac had sent him away, he took\\nhis journey and went to Mesopotamia of Syria,to Laban, the son of Bathuel, the Syrian, brother\\nto Rebecca, his mother.\\n6And Esau seeing that his father had blessed\\nJacob, and had sent him into Mesopotamia of\\nSyria, to marry a wife thence; and that after the\\nblessing he had charged him, saying: Thou shalt\\nnot take a wife of the daughters of Chanaan:\\n7And that Jacob obeying his parents, was\\ngone into Syria:\\n8Experiencing also, that his father was not\\nwell pleased with the daughters of Chanaan:\\n9He went to Ismael, and took to wife, besides\\nthem he had before, Maheleth, the daughter of\\nIsmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nabajoth.\\n10But Jacob being departed from Bersabee,\\nwent on to Haran.\\n11And when he was come to a certain place,\\nand would rest in it after sunset, he took of\\nthe stones that lay there, and putting under his\\nhead, slept in the same place.\\n12And he saw in his sleep a ladder stand-\\ning upon the earth, and the top thereof touching\\nheaven: the angels also of God ascending and\\ndescending by it.\\n13And the Lord leaning upon the ladder say-\\ning to him: I am the Lord God of Abraham thy\\nfather, and the God of Isaac: The land, wherein\\nthou sleepest, I will give to thee and to thy seed.\\n14And thy seed shall be as the dust of the\\nearth: thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and\\nto the east, and to the north, and to the south:\\nand IN THEE and thy seed, all the tribes of the\\nearth SHALL BE BLESSED.\\n15And I will be thy keeper whithersoever\\nthou goest, and will bring thee back into this\\nland: neither will I leave thee, till I shall have\\naccomplished all that I have said.\\n16And when Jacob awaked out of sleep, he\\nsaid: Indeed the Lord is in this place, and I knew\\nit not.\\n17And trembling, he said: How terrible is this\\nplace? this is no other but the house of God, and\\nthe gate of heaven.\\n18And Jacob arising in the morning, took the\\nstone which he had laid under his head, and set\\nit up for a title, pouring oil upon the top of it.\\n19And he called the name of the city Bethel,\\nwhich before was called Luza.\\n20And he made a vow, saying: If God shall\\nbe with me, and shall keep me in the way, by\\nwhich I walk, and shall give me bread to eat,\\nand raiment to put on,\\n21And I shall return prosperously to my fa-\\nther's house: the Lord shall be my God:\\n22And this stone, which I have set up for a\\ntitle, shall be called the house of God: and of\\nall things that thou shalt give to me, I will o\\x0ber\\ntithes to thee.\\nChapter 29\\nThen Jacob went on in his journey, and came\\ninto the east country.\\n2And he saw a well in the \\x0celd, and three\\n\\rocks of sheep lying by it: for the beasts were\\nwatered out of it, and the mouth thereof was\\nclosed with a great stone.\\n3And the custom was, when all the sheep\\nwere gathered together, to roll away the stone,\\nand after the sheep were watered, to put it on\\nthe mouth of the well again.\\n4And he said to the shepherds: Brethren,\\nwhence are you? They answered: Of Haran.\\n5And he asked them, saying: Know you La-\\nban, the son of Nachor? They said: We know\\nhim.\\n6He said: Is he in health? He is in health, say\\nthey: and behold, Rachel, his daughter, cometh\\nwith his \\rock.7And Jacob said: There is yet much day re-\\nmaining, neither is it time to bring the \\rocks into\\nthe folds again: \\x0crst give the sheep drink, and\\nso lead them back to feed.\\n8They answered: We cannot, till all the cattle\\nbe gathered together, and we remove the stone\\nfrom the well's mouth, that we may water the\\n\\rocks.\\n9They were yet speaking, and behold Rachel\\ncame with her father's sheep; for she fed the\\n\\rock.\\n10And when Jacob saw her, and knew her\\nto be his cousin german, and that they were the\\nsheep of Laban, his uncle: he removed the stone\\nwherewith the well was closed.\\n11And having watered the \\rock, he kissed\\nher: and lifting up his voice wept.\\n12And he told her that he was her father's\\nbrother, and the son of Rebecca: but she went\\nin haste and told her father.\\n13Who, when he heard that Jacob his sister's\\nson was come, ran forth to meet him: and em-\\nbracing him, and heartily kissing him, brought\\nhim into his house. And when he had heard the\\ncauses of his journey,\\n14He answered: Thou art my bone and my\\n\\resh. And after the days of one month were\\nexpired,\\n15He said to him: Because thou art my\\nbrother, shalt thou serve me without wages? Tell\\nme what wages thou wilt have.\\n16Now he had two daughters, the name of\\nthe elder was Lia; and the younger was called\\nRachel.\\n17But Lia was blear eyed: Rachel was well\\nfavoured, and of a beautiful countenance.\\n18And Jacob being in love with her, said:\\nI will serve thee seven years for Rachel, thy\\nyounger daughter.\\n19Laban answered: It is better that I give her\\nto thee than to another man; stay with me.\\n20So Jacob served seven years for Rachel:\\nand they seemed but a few days, because of the\\ngreatness of his love.\\n21And he said to Laban: Give me my wife;\\nfor now the time is ful\\x0clled, that I may go in\\nunto her.\\n22And he, having invited a great number of\\nhis friends to the feast, made the marriage.\\n23And at night he brought in Lia, his daugh-\\nter, to him,\\n24Giving his daughter a handmaid, named\\nZelpha. Now when Jacob had gone in to her\\naccording to custom, when morning was come\\nhe saw it was Lia.\\n25And he said to his father in law: What is\\nit that thou didst mean to do? did not I serve\\nthee for Rachel? why hast thou deceived me?\\n26Laban answered: It is not the custom in\\nthis place, to give the younger in marriage \\x0crst.\\n27Make up the week of days of this match:\\nand I will give thee her also, for the service that\\nthou shalt render me other seven years.\\n28He yielded to his pleasure: and after the\\nweek was past, he married Rachel:\\n29To whom her father gave Bala, for her ser-\\nvant.\\n30And having at length obtained the mar-\\nriage he wished for, he preferred the love of the\\nlatter before the former, and served with him\\nother seven years.\\n31And the Lord seeing that he despised Lia,\\nopened her womb, but her sister remained bar-\\nren.\\n32And she conceived and bore a son, and\\ncalled his name Ruben, saying: The Lord saw\\nmy a\\x0fiction: now my husband will love me.\\n33And again she conceived and bore a son,\\nand said: Because the Lord heard that I wasdespised, he hath given this also to me: and she\\ncalled his name Simeon.\\n34And she conceived the third time, and bore\\nanother son, and said: Now also my husband will\\nbe joined to me, because I have borne him three\\nsons: and therefore she called his name Levi.\\n35The fourth time she conceived and bore a\\nson, and said: Now will I praise the Lord: and for\\nthis she called him Juda. And she left bearing.\\nChapter 30\\nAnd Rachel seeing herself without children, en-\\nvied her sister, and said to her husband: Give\\nme children, otherwise I shall die.\\n2And Jacob being angry with her, answered:\\nAm I as God, who hath deprived thee of the fruit\\nof thy womb?\\n3But she said: I have here my servant Bala:\\ngo in unto her, that she may bear upon my knees,\\nand I may have children by her.\\n4And she gave him Bala in marriage: who,\\n5When her husband had gone in unto her,\\nconceived and bore a son.\\n6And Rachel said: The Lord hath judged for\\nme, and hath heard my voice, giving me a son;\\nand therefore she called his name Dan.\\n7And again Bala conceived, and bore another,\\n8For whom Rachel said: God hath compared\\nme with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she\\ncalled him Nephthali.\\n9Lia perceiving that she had left of bearing,\\ngave Zelpha, her handmaid, to her husband.\\n10And when she had conceived, and brought\\nforth a son,\\n11She said: Happily. And therefore called his\\nname Gad.\\n12Zelpha also bore another.\\n13And Lia said: This is for my happiness: for\\nwomen will call me blessed. Therefore she called\\nhim Aser.\\n14And Ruben going out in the time of the\\nwheat harvest into the \\x0celd, found mandrakes:\\nwhich he brought to his mother Lia. And Rachel\\nsaid: Give me part of thy son's mandrakes.\\n15She answered: Dost thou think it a small\\nmatter, that thou hast taken my husband from\\nme, unless thou take also my son's mandrakes?\\nRachel said: He shall sleep with thee this night,\\nfor thy son's mandrakes.\\n16And when Jacob returned at even from the\\n\\x0celd, Lia went out to meet him, and said: Thou\\nshalt come in unto me, because I have hired thee\\nfor my son's mandrakes. And he slept with her\\nthat night.\\n17And God heard her prayers; and she con-\\nceived: and bore a \\x0cfth son:\\n18And said: God hath given me a reward,\\nbecause I gave my handmaid to my husband.\\nAnd she called his name Issachar.\\n19And Lia conceived again, and bore the\\nsixth son,\\n20And said: God hath endowed me with a\\ngood dowry; this turn also my husband will be\\nwith me, because I have borne him six sons: and\\ntherefore she called his name Zabulon.\\n21After whom she bore a daughter, named\\nDina.\\n22The Lord also remembering Rachel, heard\\nher, and opened her womb.\\n23And she conceived, and bore a son, saying:\\nGod hath taken away my reproach.\\n24And she called his name Joseph: saying:\\nThe Lord give me also another son.\\n25And when Joseph was born, Jacob said to\\nhis father in law: Send me away, that I may\\nreturn into my country, and to my land.26Give me my wives, and my children, for\\nwhom I have served thee, that I may depart:\\nthou knowest the service that I have rendered\\nthee.\\n27Laban said to him: Let me \\x0cnd favour in\\nthy sight: I have learned, by experience, that\\nGod hath blessed me for thy sake.\\n28Appoint thy wages which I shall give thee.\\n29But he answered: Thou knowest how I have\\nserved thee, and how great thy possession hath\\nbeen in my hands.\\n30Thou hadst but little before I came to thee,\\nand now thou art become rich: and the Lord\\nhath blessed thee at my coming. It is reasonable,\\ntherefore, that I should now provide also for my\\nown house.\\n31And Laban said: What shall I give thee?\\nBut he said: I require nothing; but if thou wilt\\ndo what I demand, I will feed and keep thy sheep\\nagain.\\n32Go round through all thy \\rocks, and sepa-\\nrate all the sheep of divers colours, and speckled;\\nand all that is brown and spotted, and of divers\\ncolours, as well among the sheep as among the\\ngoats, shall be my wages.\\n33And my justice shall answer for me tomor-\\nrow before thee, when the time of the bargain\\nshall come; and all that is not of divers colours,\\nand spotted, and brown, as well among the sheep\\nas among the goats, shall accurse me of theft.\\n34And Laban said: I like well what thou de-\\nmandest.\\n35And he separated the same day the she\\ngoats, and the sheep, and the he goats, and the\\nrams of divers colours, and spotted; and all the\\n\\rock of one colour, that is, of white and black\\n\\reece, he deliverdd into the hands of his sons.\\n36And he set the space of three days journey\\nbetwixt himself and his son in law, who fed the\\nrest of his \\rock.\\n37And Jacob took green rods of poplar, and\\nof almond, and of plane trees, and pilled them\\nin part: so when the bark was taken o\\x0b, in the\\nparts that were pilled, there appeared whiteness:\\nbut the parts that were whole, remained green:\\nand by this means the colour was divers.\\n38And he put them in the troughs, where\\nthe water was poured out; that when the \\rocks\\nshould come to drink, they might have the rods\\nbefore their eyes, and in the sight of them might\\nconceive.\\n39And it came to pass, that in the very\\nheat of coition, the sheep beheld the rods, and\\nbrought forth spotted, and of divers colours, and\\nspeckled.\\n40And Jacob separated the \\rock, and put the\\nrods in the troughs before the eyes of the rams;\\nand all the white and the black were Laban's,\\nand the rest were Jacob's, when the \\rocks were\\nseparated one from the other.\\n41So when the ewes went \\x0crst to ram, Ja-\\ncob put the rods in the troughs of water before\\nthe eyes of the rams, and of the ewes, that they\\nmight conceive while they were looking upon\\nthem.\\n42But when the later coming was, and the\\nlast conceiving, he did not put them. And those\\nthat were lateward, became Laban's; and they\\nof the \\x0crst time, Jacob's.\\n43And the man was enriched exceedingly, and\\nhe had many \\rocks, maidservants and menser-\\nvants, camels and asses.\\nChapter 31\\nBut after that he had heard the words of the\\nsons of Laban, saying: Jacob hath taken away\\nall that was our father's, and being enriched by\\nhis substance is become great.2And perceiving also, that Laban's counte-\\nnance was not towards him as yesterday and the\\nother day.\\n3Especially the Lord saying to him: Return\\ninto the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred,\\nand I will be with thee.\\n4He sent, and called Rachel and Lia into the\\n\\x0celd, where he fed the \\rocks,\\n5And said to them: I see your father's coun-\\ntenance is not towards me as yesterday and the\\nother day: but the God of my father hath been\\nwith me.\\n6And you know that I have served your father\\nto the uttermost of my power.\\n7Yea your father hath also overreached me,\\nand hath changed my wages ten times: and yet\\nGod hath not su\\x0bered him to hurt me.\\n8If at any time, he said: The speckled shall be\\nthy wages: all the sheep brought forth speckled:\\nbut when he said on the contrary: Thou shalt\\ntake all the white one for thy wages: all the \\rocks\\nbrought forth white ones.\\n9And God hath taken your father's sub-\\nstance, and given it to me.\\n10For after the time came of the ewes conceiv-\\ning, I lifted up my eyes, and saw in my sleep, that\\nthe males which leaped upon the females were of\\ndivers colours, and spotted, and speckled.\\n11And the angel of God said to me in my\\nsleep: Jacob. And I answered: Here I am.\\n12And he said: Lift up thy eyes, and see that\\nall the males leaping upon the females, are of\\ndivers colours, spotted and speckled. For I have\\nseen all that Laban hath done to thee.\\n13I am the God of Bethel, where thou didst\\nanoint the stone, and make a vow to me. Now\\ntherefore arise, and go out of this land, and re-\\nturn into thy native country.\\n14And Rachel and Lia answered: Have we\\nany thing left among the goods and inheritance\\nof our father's house?\\n15Hath he not counted us as strangers, and\\nsold us, and eaten up the price of us?\\n16But God hath taken our father's riches, and\\ndelivered them to us, and to our children: where-\\nfore, do all that God hath commanded thee.\\n17Then Jacob rose up, and having set his\\nchildren and wives upon camels, went his way.\\n18And he took all his substance, and \\rocks,\\nand whatsoever he had gotten in Mesopotamia,\\nand went forward to Isaac, his father, to the land\\nof Chanaan.\\n19At that time Laban was gone to shear his\\nsheep, and Rachel stole away her father's idols.\\n20And Jacob would not confess to his father\\nin law that he was \\rying away.\\n21And when he was gone, together with all\\nthat belonged to him, and having passed the\\nriver, was going on towards mount Galaad,\\n22It was told Laban on the third day, that\\nJacob \\red.\\n23And he took his brethren with him, and\\npursued after him seven days; and overtook him\\nin the mount of Galaad.\\n24And he saw in a dream God, saying to\\nhim: Take heed thou speak not any thing harshly\\nagainst Jacob.\\n25Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the\\nmountain: and when he, with his brethren, had\\novertaken him, he pitched his tent in the same\\nmount of Galaad.\\n26And he said to Jacob: Why hast thou done\\nthus, to carry away, without my knowledge, my\\ndaughters as captives taken with the sword?\\n27Why wouldst thou run away privately, and\\nnot acquaint me, that I might have brought thee\\non the way with joy, and with songs, and with\\ntimbrels, and with harps?\\n28Thou hast not su\\x0bered me to kiss my sons\\nand daughters; thou hast done foolishly; and nowindeed,\\n29It is in my power to return thee evil; but the\\nGod of your father said to me yesterday: Take\\nheed thou speak not any thing harshly against\\nJacob.\\n30Suppose thou didst desire to go to thy\\nfriends, and hadst a longing after thy father's\\nhouse: why hast thou stolen away my gods?\\n31Jacob answered: That I departed unknown\\nto thee, it was for fear lest thou wouldst take\\naway thy daughters by force.\\n32But, whereas, thou chargest me with theft:\\nwith whomsoever thou shalt \\x0cnd thy gods, let\\nhim be slain before our brethren. Search, and if\\nthou \\x0cnd any of thy things with me, take them\\naway. Now when he said this, he knew not that\\nRachel had stolen the idols.\\n33So Laban went into the tent of Jacob,\\nand of Lia, and of both the handmaids, and\\nfound them not. And when he was entered into\\nRachel's tent,\\n34She, in haste, hid the idols under the\\ncamel's furniture, and sat upon them: and when\\nhe had searched all the tent, and found nothing,\\n35She said: Let not my lord be angry that\\nI cannot rise up before thee, because it has\\nnow happened to me according to the custom\\nof women. So his careful search was in vain.\\n36And Jacob being angry, said in a chiding\\nmanner: For what fault of mine, and for what\\no\\x0bence on my part hast thou so hotly pursued\\nme,\\n37And searched all my household stu\\x0b?\\nWhat hast thou found of all the substance of thy\\nhouse? lay it here before my brethren, and thy\\nbrethren, and let them judge between me and\\nthee.\\n38Have I, therefore, been with thee twenty\\nyears? thy ewes and goats were not barren, the\\nrams of thy \\rocks I did not eat:\\n39Neither did I shew thee that which the\\nbeast had torn; I made good all the damage:\\nwhatsoever was lost by theft, thou didst exact it\\nof me:\\n40Day and night was I parched with heat, and\\nwith frost, and sleep departed from my eyes.\\n41And in this manner have I served thee in\\nthy house twenty years, fourteen for thy daugh-\\nters, and six for thy \\rocks: thou hast changed\\nalso my wages ten times.\\n42Unless the God of my father, Abraham,\\nand the fear of Isaac, had stood by me, peradven-\\nture now thou hadst sent me away naked: God\\nbeheld my a\\x0fiction and the labour of my hands,\\nand rebuked thee yesterday.\\n43Laban answered him: The daughters are\\nmine, and the children, and thy \\rocks, and all\\nthings that thou seest are mine: what can I do\\nto my children, and grandchildren?\\n44Come, therefore, let us enter into a league;\\nthat it may be for a testimony between me and\\nthee.\\n45And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for\\na title.\\n46And he said to his brethren: Bring hither\\nstones. And they, gathering stones together,\\nmade a heap, and they ate upon it.\\n47And Laban called it, The witness heap; and\\nJacob, The hillock of testimony: each of them\\naccording to the propriety of his language.\\n48And Laban said: This heap shall be a wit-\\nness between me and thee this day, and therefore\\nthe name thereof was called Galaad, that is, The\\nwitness heap.\\n49The Lord behold and judge between us,\\nwhen we shall be gone one from the other.\\n50If thou a\\x0fict my daughters, and if thou\\nbring in other wives over them: none is witness\\nof our speech but God, who is present and be-\\nholdeth.51And he said again to Jacob: Behold this\\nheap, and the stone which I have set up between\\nme and thee,\\n52Shall be a witness: this heap, I say, and\\nthe stone, be they for a testimony, if either I\\nshall pass beyond it going towards thee, or thou\\nshalt pass beyond it thinking harm to me.\\n53The God of Abraham, and the God of Na-\\nchor, the God of their father, judge betweeen us.\\nAnd Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac:\\n54And after he had o\\x0bered sacri\\x0cces in the\\nmountain, he called his brethren to eat bread.\\nAnd when they had eaten, they lodged there:\\n55But Laban arose in the night, and kissed\\nhis sons and daughters, and blessed them: and\\nreturned to his place.\\nChapter 32\\nJacob also went on the journey he had begun:\\nand the angels of God met him.\\n2And when he saw them, he said: These are\\nthe camps of God, and he called the name of\\nthat place Mahanaim, that is, Camps.\\n3And he sent messengers before him to Esau,\\nhis brother, to the land of Seir, to the country of\\nEdom:\\n4And he commanded them, saying: Thus\\nshall ye speak to my lord Esau: Thus saith thy\\nbrother Jacob: I have sojourned with Laban, and\\nhave been with him until this day:\\n5I have oxen, and asses, and sheep, and\\nmenservants, and womenservants: and now I\\nsend a message to my lord, that I may \\x0cnd favour\\nin thy sight.\\n6And the messengers returned to Jacob, say-\\ning: We came to Esau, thy brother, and behold\\nhe cometh with speed to meet thee with four\\nhundred men.\\n7Then Jacob was greatly afraid; and in his\\nfear divided the people that was with him, and\\nthe \\rocks, and the sheep, and the oxen, and the\\ncamels, into two companies,\\n8Saying: If Esau come to one company, and\\ndestroy it, the other company that is left, shall\\nescape.\\n9And Jacob said: O God of my fahter Abra-\\nham, and God of my father Isaac: O Lord who\\nsaidst to me, Return to thy land, and to the place\\nof thy birth, and I will do well for thee.\\n10I am not worthy of the least of all thy mer-\\ncies, and of thy truth which thou hast ful\\x0clled\\nto thy servant. With my sta\\x0b I passed over this\\nJordan; and now I return with two companies.\\n11Deliver me from the hand of my brother\\nEsau, for I am greatly afraid of him; lest perhaps\\nhe come, and kill the mother with the children.\\n12Thou didst say, that thou wouldst do well\\nby me, and multiply my seed like the sand of the\\nsea, which connot be numbered for multitude.\\n13And when he had slept there that night, he\\nset apart, of the things which he had, presents\\nfor his brother Esau,\\n14Two hundred she goats, twenty he goats,\\ntwo hundred ewes, and twenty rams,\\n15Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty\\nkine, and twenty bulls, twenty she asses, and ten\\nof their foals.\\n16And he sent them by the hands of his ser-\\nvants, every drove by itself, and he said to his\\nservants: Go before me, and let there be a space\\nbetween drove and drove.\\n17And he commanded the \\x0crst, saying: If\\nthou meet my brother Esau, and he ask thee:\\nWhose art thou? or whither goest thou? or\\nwhose are these before thee?\\n18Thou shalt answer: Thy servant Jacob's:\\nhe hath sent them as a present to my lord Esau;\\nand he cometh after us.19In like manner he commanded the second,\\nand the third, and all that followed the droves,\\nsaying: Speak ye the same words to Esau, when\\nye \\x0cnd him.\\n20And ye shall add: Thy servant Jacob him-\\nself also followeth after us; for he said: I will\\nappease him with the presents that go before,\\nand afterwards I will see him, perhaps he will be\\ngracious to me.\\n21So the presents went before him, but him-\\nself lodged that night in the camp.\\n22And rising early, he took his two wives and\\nhis two handmaids, with his eleven sons, and\\npassed over the ford of Jaboc.\\n23And when all things were brought over that\\nbelonged to him,\\n24He remained alone; and behold, a man\\nwrestled with him till morning.\\n25And when he saw that he could not over-\\ncome him, he touched the sinew of his thigh, and\\nforthwith it shrank.\\n26And he said to him: Let me go, for it is\\nbreak of day. He answered: I will not let thee\\ngo, except thou bless me.\\n27And he said: What is thy name? He an-\\nswered: Jacob.\\n28But he said: Thy name shall not be called\\nJacob, but Israel; for if thou hast been strong\\nagainst God, how much more shalt thou prevail\\nagainst men?\\n29Jacob asked him: Tell me by what name\\nart thou called? He answered: Why dost thou\\nask my name? And he blessed him in the same\\nplace.\\n30And Jacob called the name of the place\\nPhanuel, saying: I have seen God face to face,\\nand my soul has been saved.\\n31And immediately the sun rose upon him,\\nafter he was past Phanuel; but he halted on his\\nfoot.\\n32Therefore the children of Israel, unto this\\nday, eat not the sinew, that shrank in Jacob's\\nthigh: because he touched the sinew of his thigh\\nand it shrank.\\nChapter 33\\nAnd Jacob lifting up his eyes, saw Esau coming,\\nand with him four hundred men: and he divided\\nthe children of Lia and of Rachel, and of the two\\nhandmaids.\\n2And he put both the handmaids and their\\nchildren foremost: and Lia and her children in\\nthe second place: and Rachel and Joseph last.\\n3And he went forward and bowed down with\\nhis face to the ground seven times, until his\\nbrother came near.\\n4Then Esau ran to meet his brother, and em-\\nbraced him: and clasping him fast about the\\nneck, and kissing him, wept.\\n5And lifting up his eyes, he saw the women\\nand their children, and said: What mean these?\\nAnd do they belong to thee? He answered: They\\nare the children which God hath given to me, thy\\nservant.\\n6Then the handmaids and their children came\\nnear and bowed themselves.\\n7Lia also, with her children, came near and\\nbowed down in like manner; and last of all,\\nJoseph and Rachel bowed down.\\n8And Esau said: What are the droves that\\nI met? He answered: That I might \\x0cnd favour\\nbefore my lord.\\n9But he said: I have plenty, my brother, keep\\nwhat is thine for thyself.\\n10And Jacob said: Do not so I beseech thee,\\nbut if I have found favour in thy eyes, receive a\\nlittle present at my hands: for I have seen thy\\nface, as if I should have seen the countenance ofGod: be gracious to me,\\n11And take the blessing which I have brought\\nthee, and which God hath given me, who giveth\\nall things. He took it with much ado at his\\nbrother's earnest pressing him,\\n12And said: Let us go on together, and I will\\naccompany thee in thy journey.\\n13And Jacob said: My lord, thou knowest\\nthat I have with me tender children, and sheep,\\nand kine with young: which if I should cause to\\nbe overdriven, in one day all the \\rocks will die.\\n14May it please my lord to go before his ser-\\nvant: and I will follow softly after him, as I shall\\nsee my children to be able, until I come to my\\nlord in Seir.\\n15Esau answered: I beseech thee, that some\\nof the people, at least, who are with me, may\\nstay to accompany thee in the way. And he said:\\nThere is no necessity: I want nothing else but\\nonly to \\x0cnd favour, my lord, in thy sight.\\n16So Esau returned that day, the way that\\nhe came, to Seir.\\n17And Jacob came to Socoth: where having\\nbuilt a house, and pitched tents, he called the\\nname of the place Socoth, that is, Tents.\\n18And he passed over to Salem, a city of the\\nSichemites, which is in the land of Chanaan, af-\\nter he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria: and\\nhe dwelt by the town.\\n19And he bought that part of the \\x0celd, in\\nwhich he pitched his tents, of the children of\\nHemor, the father of Sichem, for a hundred\\nlambs.\\n20And raising an altar there, he invoked upon\\nit the most mighty God of Israel.\\nChapter 34\\nAnd Dina the daughter of Lia went out to see\\nthe women of that country.\\n2And when Sichem the son of Hemor the\\nHevite, the prince of that land, saw her, he was\\nin love with her: and took her away, and lay with\\nher, ravishing the virgin.\\n3And his soul was fast knit unto her; and\\nwhereas she was sad, he comforted her with\\nsweet words.\\n4And going to Hemor his father, he said: Get\\nme this damsel to wife.\\n5But when Jacob had heard this, his sons\\nbeing absent, and employed in feeding the cattle,\\nhe held his peace till they came back.\\n6And when Hemor the father of Sichem was\\ncome out to speak to Jacob,\\n7Behold his sons came from the \\x0celd: and\\nhearing what had passed, they were exceeding\\nangry, because he had done a foul thing in Israel,\\nand committed an unlawful act, in ravishing Ja-\\ncob's daughter.\\n8And Hemor spoke to them: The soul of my\\nson Sichem has a longing for your daughter: give\\nher him to wife:\\n9And let us contract marriages one with an-\\nother: give us your daughters, and take you our\\ndaughters.\\n10And dwell with us: the land is at your\\ncommand, till, trade, and possess it.\\n11Sichem also said to her father and to her\\nbrethren: Let me \\x0cnd favour in your sight, and\\nwhatsoever you shall appoint I will give:\\n12Raise the dowry, and ask gifts, and I will\\ngladly give what you shall demand: only give me\\nthis damsel to wife.\\n13The sons of Jacob answered Sichem and his\\nfather deceitfully, being enraged at the de\\rower-\\ning of their sister:14We cannot do what you demand, nor give\\nour sister to one that is uncircumcised; which\\nwith us is unlawful and abominable.\\n15But in this we may be allied with you, if\\nyou will be like us, and all the male sex among\\nyou be circumcised:\\n16Then will we mutually give and take your\\ndaughters, and ours; and we will dwell with you,\\nand will be one people:\\n17But if you will not be circumcised, we will\\ntake our daughter and depart.\\n18Their o\\x0ber pleased Hemor, and Sichem, his\\nson:\\n19And the young man made no delay, but\\nforthwith ful\\x0clled what was required: for he\\nloved the damsel exceedingly, and he was the\\ngreatest man in all his father's house.\\n20And going into the gate of the city, they\\nspoke to the people:\\n21These men are peaceable, and are willing\\nto dwell with us: let them trade in the land, and\\ntill it, which being large and wide wanteth men\\nto till it: we shall take their daughters for wives,\\nand we will give them ours.\\n22One thing there is for which so great a\\ngood is deferred: We must circumcise every male\\namong us, following the manner of the nation.\\n23And their substance, and cattle, and all\\nthat they possess, shall be ours; only in this let us\\ncondescend, and by dwelling together, we shall\\nmake one people.\\n24And they all agreed, and circumcised all\\nthe males.\\n25And behold the third day, when the pain\\nof the wound was greatest: two of the sons of\\nJacob, Simeon and Levi, the brothers of Dina,\\ntaking their swords, entered boldly into the city\\nand slew all the men.\\n26And they killed also Hemor and Sichem,\\nand took away their sister Dina out of Sichem's\\nhouse.\\n27And when they were gone out, the other\\nsons of Jacob came upon the slain; and plun-\\ndered the city in revenge of the rape.\\n28And they took their sheep, and their herds,\\nand their asses, wasting all they had in their\\nhouses and in their \\x0celds.\\n29And their children and wives they took\\ncaptive.\\n30And when they had boldly perpetrated\\nthese things, Jacob said to Simeon and Levi: You\\nhave troubled me, and made me hateful to the\\nChanaanites and Pherezites, the inhabitants of\\nthis land. We are few: they will gather them-\\nselves together and kill me; and both I, and my\\nhouse shall be destroyed.\\n31They answered: Should they abuse our sis-\\nter as a strumpet?\\nChapter 35\\nIn the mean time God said to Jacob: Arise and\\ngo up to Bethel, and dwell there, and make there\\nan altar to God, who appeared to thee when thou\\ndidst \\ree from Esau, thy brother.\\n2And Jacob having called together all his\\nhousehold, said: Cast away the strange gods that\\nare among you, and be cleansed, and change your\\ngarments.\\n3Arise, and let us go up to Bethel, that we\\nmay make there an altar to God; who heard me\\nin the day of my a\\x0fiction, and accompained me\\nin my journey.\\n4So they gave him all the strange gods they\\nhad, and the earrings which were in their ears:\\nand he buried them under the turpentine tree,\\nthat is behind the city of Sichem.\\n5And when they were departed, the terror\\nof God fell upon all the cities round about, andthey durst not pursue after them as they went\\naway.\\n6And Jacob came to Luza, which is in the\\nland of Chanaan, surnamed Bethel: he and all\\nthe people that were with him.\\n7And he built there an altar, and called the\\nname of that place, The house of God: for there\\nGod appeared to him when he \\red from his\\nbrother.\\n8At the same time Debora, the nurse of Re-\\nbecca, died, and was buried at the foot of Bethel,\\nunder an oak, and the name of that place was\\ncalled, The oak of weeping.\\n9And God appeared again to Jacob, after\\nhe returned from Mesopotamia of Syria, and he\\nblessed him,\\n10Saying: Thou shalt not be called any more\\nJacob, but Israel shall be thy name. And he\\ncalled him Israel.\\n11And said to him: I am God almighty, in-\\ncrease thou and be multiplied. Nations and peo-\\nples of nations shall be from thee, and kings shall\\ncome out of thy loins.\\n12And the land which I gave to Abraham and\\nIsaac, I will give to thee, and to thy seed after\\nthee.\\n13And he departed from him.\\n14But he set up a monument of stone, in the\\nplace where God had spoken to him: pouring\\ndrink \\x0berings upon it, and pouring oil thereon:\\n15And calling the name of that place Bethel.\\n16And going forth from thence, he came in\\nthe spring time to the land which leadeth to\\nEphrata: wherein when Rachel was in travail,\\n17By reason of her hard labour, she began to\\nbe in danger, and the midwife said to her: Fear\\nnot, for thou shalt have this son also.\\n18And when her soul was departing for pain,\\nand death was now at hand, she called the name\\nof her son Benoni, that is, the son of my pain:\\nbut his father called him Benjamin, that is, the\\nson of the right hand.\\n19So Rachel died, and was buried in the high-\\nway that leadeth to Ephrata, this is Bethlehem.\\n20And Jacob erected a pillar over her sepul-\\nchre: this is the pillar of Rachel's monument, to\\nthis day.\\n21Departing thence, he pitched his tent be-\\nyond the Flock tower.\\n22And when he dwelt in that country, Ruben\\nwent, and slept with Bala the concubine of his\\nfather: which he was not ignorant of. Now the\\nsons of Jacob were twelve.\\n23The sons of Lia: Ruben the \\x0crst born, and\\nSimeon, and Levi, and Juda, and Issachar, and\\nZabulon.\\n24The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.\\n25The sons of Bala, Rachel's handmaid: Dan\\nand Nephthali.\\n26The sons of Zelpha, Lia's handmaid: Gad\\nand Aser: these are the sons of Jacob, that were\\nborn to him in Mesopotamia of Syria.\\n27And he came to Isaac his father in Mam-\\nbre, the city of Arbee, this is Hebron: wherein\\nAbraham and Isaac sojourned.\\n28And the days of Isaac were a hundred and\\neighty years.\\n29And being spent with age he died, and was\\ngathered to his people, being old and full of days:\\nand his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.\\nChapter 36\\nAnd these are the generations of Esau, the same\\nis Edom.\\n2Esau took wives of the daughters of\\nChanaan: Ada the daughter of Elon the Hethite,\\nand Oolibama the daughter of Ana, the daughter\\nof Sebeon the Hevite:3And Basemath, the daughter of Ismael, sis-\\nter of Nabajoth.\\n4And Ada bore Eliphaz: Basemath bore\\nRahuel.\\n5Oolibama bore Jehus, and Ihelon, and Core.\\nThese are the sons of Esau, that were born to\\nhim in the land of Chanaan.\\n6And Esau took his wives, and his sons and\\ndaughters, and every soul of his house, and his\\nsubstance, and cattle, and all that he was able\\nto acquire in the land of Chanaan: and went into\\nanother country, and departed from his brother\\nJacob.\\n7For they were exceeding rich, and could not\\ndwell together: neither was the land in which\\nthey sojourned able to bear them, for the multi-\\ntude of their \\rocks.\\n8And Esau dwelt in mount Seir: he is Edom.\\n9And these are the generations of Esau, the\\nfather of Edom, in mount Seir.\\n10And these the names of his sons: Eliphaz\\nthe son of Ada, the wife of Esau: and Rahuel,\\nthe son of Basemath, his wife.\\n11And Eliphaz had sons: Theman, Omar,\\nSepho, and Gatham and Cenez.\\n12And Thamna was the concubine of Eliphaz,\\nthe son of Esau: and she bore him Amalech.\\nThese are the sons of Ada, the wife of Esau.\\n13And the sons of Rahuel were Nahath and\\nZara, Samma and Meza. These were the sons of\\nBasemath, the wife of Esau.\\n14And these were the sons of Oolibama, the\\ndaughter of Ana, the daughter of Sebeon, the\\nwife of Esau, whom she bore to him, Jehus, and\\nIhelon, and Core.\\n15These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the\\nsons of Eliphaz, the \\x0crstborn of Esau: duke The-\\nman, duke Omar, duke Sepho, duke Cenez,\\n16Duke Core, duke Gatham, duke Amalech:\\nthese are the sons of Eliphaz, in the land of\\nEdom, and these the sons of Ada.\\n17And these were the sons of Rahuel, the son\\nof Esau: duke Nahath, duke Zara, duke Samma,\\nduke Meza. And these are the dukes of Rahuel,\\nin the land of Edom: these the sons of Basemath,\\nthe wife of Esau.\\n18And these the sons of Oolibama, the wife\\nof Esau: duke Jehus, duke Ihelon, duke Core.\\nThese are the dukes of Oolibama, the daughter\\nof Ana, and wife of Esau.\\n19These are the sons of Esau, and these the\\ndukes of them: the same is Edom.\\n20These are the sons of Seir, the Horrite, the\\ninhabitants of the land: Lotan, and Sobal, and\\nSebeon, and Ana,\\n21And Dison, and Eser, and Disan. These\\nare dukes of the Horrites, the sons of Seir, in the\\nland of Edom.\\n22And Lotan had sons: Hori and Heman.\\nAnd the sister of Lotan was Thamna.\\n23And these the sons of Sobal: Alvan, and\\nManahat, and Ebal, and Sepho, and Onam.\\n24And these the sons of Sebeon: Aia and\\nAna.

And Joseph went forward\\nafter his brethren, and found them in Dothain.\\n18And when they saw him afar o\\x0b, before he\\ncame nigh them, they thought to kill him:\\n19And said one to another: Behold the\\ndreamer cometh.\\n20Come, let us kill him, and cast him into\\nsome old pit: and we will say: Some evil beast\\nhath devoured him: and then it shall appear\\nwhat his dreams avail him:\\n21And Ruben hearing this, endeavoured to\\ndeliver him out of their hands, and said:\\n22Do not take away his life, nor shed his\\nblood: but cast him into this pit, that is in the\\nwilderness, and keep your hands harmless: now\\nhe said this, being desirous to deliver him out of\\ntheir hands and to restore him to his father.\\n23And as soon as he came to his brethren,\\nthey forthwith stript him of his outside coat, that\\nwas of divers colours:\\n24And cast him into an old pit where there\\nwas not water.\\n25And sitting down to eat bread, they\\nsaw some Ismaelites on their way coming from\\nGalaad, with their camels, carrying spices, and\\nbalm, and myrrh to Egypt.\\n26And Juda said to his brethren: What will\\nit pro\\x0ct us to kill our brother, and conceal his\\nblood?\\n27It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites,\\nand that our hands be not de\\x0cled: for he is our\\nbrother and our \\resh. His brethren agreed to his\\nwords.\\n28And when the Madianite merchants passed\\nby, they drew him out of the pit, and sold him\\nto the Ismaelites, for twenty pieces of silver: and\\nthey led him into Egypt.\\n29And Ruben returning to the pit, found not\\nthe boy:\\n30And rending his garments he went to his\\nbrethren, and said: The boy doth not appear,\\nand whither shall I go?\\n31And they took his coat, and dipped it in\\nthe blood of a kid, which they had killed:\\n32Sending some to carry it to their father,\\nand to say: This we have found: see whether it\\nbe thy son's coat, or not.\\n33And the father acknowledging it, said: It\\nis my son's coat, an evil wild beast hath eaten\\nhim, a beast hath devoured Joseph.\\n34And tearing his garments, he put on sack-\\ncloth, mourning for his son a long time.\\n35And all his children being gathered to-\\ngether to comfort their father in his sorrow, he\\nwould not receive comfort, but said: I will go\\ndown to my son into hell, mourning. And whilst\\nhe continued weeping,\\n36The Madianites sold Joseph in Egypt to\\nPutiphar, an eunuch of Pharao, captain of the\\nsoldiers.\\nChapter 38\\nAt that time Juda went down from his brethren,\\nand turned in to a certain Odollamite, named\\nHiras.\\n2And he saw there the daughter of a man of\\nChanaan, called Sue: and taking her to wife, he\\nwent in unto her.3And she conceived, and bore a son, and\\ncalled his name Her.\\n4And conceiving again, she bore a son, and\\ncalled him Onan.\\n5She bore also a third: whom she called Sela.\\nAfter whose birth, she ceased to bear any more.\\n6And Juda took a wife for Her, his \\x0crst born,\\nwhose name was Thamar.\\n7And Her, the \\x0crst born of Juda, was wicked\\nin the sight of the Lord: and was slain by him.\\n8Juda, therefore, said to Onan his son: Go in\\nto thy brother's wife and marry her, that thou\\nmayst raise seed to thy brother.\\n9He knowing that the children should not be\\nhis, when he went in to his brother's wife, he\\nspilled his seed upon the ground, lest children\\nshould be born in his brother's name.\\n10And therefore the Lord slew him, because\\nhe did a detestable thing:\\n11Wherefore Juda said to Thamar his\\ndaughter-in-law: Remain a widow in thy father's\\nhouse, till Sela my son grow up: for he was afraid\\nlest he also might die, as his brethren did. She\\nwent her way, and dwelt in her father's house.\\n12And after many days were past: the daugh-\\nter of Sue the wife of Juda died: and when he\\nhad taken comfort after his mourning, he went\\nup to Thamnas, to the shearers of his sheep, he\\nand Hiras the Odollamite, the shepherd of his\\n\\rock.\\n13And it was told Thamar that her father-in-\\nlaw was come up to Thamnas to shear his sheep.\\n14And she put o\\x0b the garments of her widow-\\nhood, and took a veil: and changing her dress,\\nsat in the cross way, that leadeth to Thamnas:\\nbecause Sela was grown up, and she had not been\\nmarried to him.\\n15When Juda saw her, he thought she was\\na harlot: for she had covered her face, lest she\\nshould be known.\\n16And going to her, he said: Su\\x0ber me to\\nlie with thee: for he knew her not to be his\\ndaughter-in-law. And she answered: What wilt\\nthou give me to enjoy my company?\\n17He said: I will send thee a kid out of the\\n\\rock. And when she said again: I will su\\x0ber\\nwhat thou wilt, if thou give me a pledge, till\\nthou send what thou promisest.\\n18Juda said: What wilt thou have for a\\npledge? She answered: Thy ring and bracelet,\\nand the sta\\x0b which thou holdest in thy hand.\\nThe woman therefore at one copulation con-\\nceived.\\n19And she arose and went her way: and\\nputting o\\x0b the apparel which she had taken, put\\non the garments of her widowhood.\\n20And Juda sent a kid by his shepherd, the\\nOdollamite, that he might receive the pledge\\nagain, which he had given to the woman: but\\nhe, not \\x0cnding her,\\n21Asked the men of that place: Where is the\\nwoman that sat in the cross way? And when\\nthey all made answer: There was no harlot in\\nthis place,\\n22He returned to Juda, and said to him: I\\nhave not found her; moreover, the men of that\\nplace said to me, that there never sat a harlot\\nthere.\\n23Juda said: Let her take it to herself, surely\\nshe cannot charge us with a lie, I sent the kid\\nwhich I promised: and thou didst not \\x0cnd her.\\n24And behold, after three months, they told\\nJuda, saying: Thamar, thy daughter-in-law,\\nhath played the harlot, and she appeareth to\\nhave a big belly. And Juda said: Bring her out\\nthat she may be burnt.\\n25But when she was led to execution, she\\nsent to her father in law, saying: By the man, to\\nwhom these things belong, I am with child. See\\nwhose ring, and bracelet, and sta\\x0b this is.26But he acknowledging the gifts, said: She\\nis juster than I: because I did not give her to\\nSela, my son. However he knew her no more.\\n27And when she was ready to be brought to\\nbed, there appeared twins in her womb: and in\\nthe very delivery of the infants, one put forth a\\nhand, whereon the midwife tied a scarlet thread,\\nsaying:\\n28This shall come forth the \\x0crst.\\n29But he drawing back his hand, the other\\ncame forth: and the woman said: Why is the\\npartition divided for thee? and therefore called\\nhis name Phares.\\n30Afterwards his brother came out, on whose\\nhand was the scarlet thread: and she called his\\nname Zara.\\nChapter 39\\nAnd Joseph was brought into Egypt, and\\nPutiphar, an eunuch of Pharao, chief captain of\\nthe army, an Egyptian, bought him of the Is-\\nmaelites, by whom he was brought.\\n2And the Lord was with him, and he was a\\nprosperous man in all things: and he dwelt in\\nhis master's house:\\n3Who knew very well that the Lord was with\\nhim, and made all that he did to prosper in his\\nhand.\\n4And Joseph found favour in the sight of his\\nmaster, and ministered to him: and being set\\nover all by him, he governed the house commit-\\nted to him, and all things that were delivered to\\nhim:\\n5And the Lord blessed the house of the Egyp-\\ntian for Joseph's sake, and multiplied all his sub-\\nstance, both at home and in the \\x0celds.\\n6Neither knew he any other thing, but the\\nbread which he ate. And Joseph was of a beau-\\ntiful countenance, and comely to behold.\\n7And after many days, his mistress cast her\\neyes on Joseph, and said: Lie with me.\\n8But he in no wise consenting to that wicked\\nact said to her: Behold, my master hath deliv-\\nered all things to me, and knoweth not what he\\nhath in his own house:\\n9Neither is there any thing which is not in\\nmy power, or that he hath not delivered to me,\\nbut thee, who art his wife; how then can I do\\nthis wicked thing, and sin against my God?\\n10With such words as these day by day, both\\nthe woman was importunate with the young\\nman, and he refused the adultery.\\n11Now it happened on a certain day, that\\nJoseph went into the house, and was doing some\\nbusiness, without any man with him:\\n12And she catching the skirt of his garment,\\nsaid: Lie with me. But he leaving the garment\\nin her hand, \\red, and went out.\\n13And when the woman saw the garment in\\nher hands, and herself disregarded,\\n14She called to her the men of her house, and\\nsaid to them: See, he hath brought in a Hebrew,\\nto abuse us: he came in to me, to lie with me;\\nand when I cried out,\\n15And he heard my voice, he left the garment\\nthat I held, and got him out.\\n16For a proof therefore of her \\x0cdelity, she\\nkept the garment, and shewed it to her husband\\nwhen he returned home:\\n17And said: The Hebrew servant, whom thou\\nhast brought, came to me to abuse me.\\n18And when he heard me cry, he left the gar-\\nment which I held, and \\red out.\\n19His master hearing these things, and giving\\ntoo much credit to his wife's words, was very\\nangry,\\n20And cast Joseph into the prison, where the\\nking's prisoners were kept, and he was there shutup.\\n21But the Lord was with Joseph, and having\\nmercy upon him gave him favour in the sight of\\nthe chief keeper of the prison:\\n22Who delivered into his hand all the prison-\\ners that were kept in custody: and whatsoever\\nwas done, was under him.\\n23Neither did he himself know any thing, hav-\\ning committed all things to him: for the Lord\\nwas with him, and made all that he did to pros-\\nper.\\nChapter 40\\nAfter this, it came to pass, that two eunuchs,\\nthe butler and the baker of the king of Egypt,\\no\\x0bended their lord.\\n2And Pharao being angry with them, (now\\nthe one was chief butler, the other chief baker,)\\n3He sent them to the prison of the commander\\nof the soldiers, in which Joseph also was prisoner.\\n4But the keeper of the prison delivered them\\nto Joseph, and he served them. Some little time\\npassed, and they were kept in custody.\\n5And they both dreamed a dream the same\\nnight, according to the interpretation agreeing\\nto themselves:\\n6And when Joseph was come into them in the\\nmorning, and saw them sad,\\n7He asked them, saying: Why is your coun-\\ntenance sadder today than usual?\\n8They answered: We have dreamed a dream,\\nand there is nobody to interpret it to us. And\\nJoseph said to them: Doth not interpretation\\nbelong to God? Tell me what you have dreamed:\\n9The chief butler \\x0crst told his dream: I saw\\nbefore me a vine,\\n10On which were three branches, which by\\nlittle and little sent out buds, and after the blos-\\nsoms brought forth ripe grapes:\\n11And the cup of Pharao was in my hand:\\nand I took the grapes, and pressed them into the\\ncup which I held, and I gave the cup to Pharao.\\n12Joseph answered: This is the interpretation\\nof the dream: The three branches, are yet three\\ndays:\\n13After which Pharao will remember thy ser-\\nvice, and will restore thee to thy former place:\\nand thou shalt present him the cup according to\\nthy o\\x0ece, as before thou was wont to do.\\n14Only remember me when it shall be well\\nwith thee, and do me this kindness: to put\\nPharao in mind to take me out of this prison:\\n15For I was stolen away out of the land of the\\nHebrews, and here without any fault was cast\\ninto the dungeon.\\n16The chief baker seeing that he had wisely\\ninterpreted the dream, said: I also dreamed a\\ndream, That I had three baskets of meal upon\\nmy head:\\n17And that in one basket which was upper-\\nmost, I carried all meats that are made by the\\nart of baking, and that the birds ate out of it.\\n18Joseph answered: This is the interpretation\\nof the dream: The three baskets, are yet three\\ndays:\\n19After which Pharao will take thy head from\\nthee, and hang thee on a cross, and the birds\\nshall tear thy \\resh.\\n20The third day after this was the birthday\\nof Pharao: and he made a great feast for his\\nservants, and at the banquet remembered the\\nchief butler, and the chief baker.\\n21And he restored the one to his place, to\\npresent him the cup:\\n22The other he hanged on a gibbet, that the\\ntruth of the interpreter might be shewn.\\n23But the chief butler, when things prospered\\nwith him, forgot his interpreter.Chapter 41\\nAfter two years Pharao had a dream. He thought\\nhe stood by the river,\\n2Out of which came up seven kine, very beau-\\ntiful and fat: and they fed in marshy places.\\n3Other seven also came up out of the river, ill\\nfavoured, and lean \\reshed: and they fed on the\\nvery bank of the river, in green places:\\n4And they devoured them, whose bodies were\\nvery beautiful and well conditioned. So Pharao\\nawoke.\\n5He slept again, and dreamed another dream:\\nSeven ears of corn came up upon one stalk full\\nand fair:\\n6Then seven other ears sprung up thin and\\nblasted,\\n7And devoured all the beauty of the former.\\nPharao awaked after his rest:\\n8And when morning was come, being struck\\nwith fear, he sent to all the interpreters of Egypt,\\nand to all the wise men: and they being called\\nfor, he told them his dream, and there was not\\nany one that could interpret it.\\n9Then at length the chief butler remember-\\ning, said: I confess my sin:\\n10The king being angry with his servants,\\ncommanded me and the chief baker to be cast\\ninto the prison of the captain of the soldiers.\\n11Where in one night both of us dreamed a\\ndream forboding things to come.\\n12There was there a young man a Hebrew,\\nservant to the same captain of the soldiers: to\\nwhom we told our dreams,\\n13And we heard what afterwards the event\\nof the thing proved to be so. For I was restored\\nto my o\\x0ece: and he was hanged upon a gibbet.\\n14Forthwith at the king's command Joseph\\nwas brought out of the prison, and they shaved\\nhim: and changing his apparel brought him in\\nto him.\\n15And he said to him: I have dreamed\\ndreams, and there is no one that can expound\\nthem: Now I have heard that thou art very wise\\nat interpreting them:\\n16Joseph answered: Without me, God shall\\ngive Pharao a prosperous answer.\\n17So Pharao told what he had dreamed:\\nMethought I stood upon the bank of the river,\\n18And seven kine came up out of the river,\\nexceeding beautiful and full of \\resh: and they\\ngrazed on green places in a marshy pasture.\\n19And behold, there followed these, other\\nseven kine, so very ill favoured and lean, that\\nI never saw the like in the land of Egypt:\\n20And they devoured and consumed the for-\\nmer,\\n21And yet gave no mark of their being full:\\nbut were as lean and ill favoured as before. I\\nawoke, and then fell asleep again,\\n22And dreamed a dream: Seven ears of corn\\ngrew up upon one stalk, full and very fair.\\n23Other seven also thin and blasted, sprung\\nof the stalk:\\n24And they devoured the beauty of the for-\\nmer: I told this dream to the conjecturers, and\\nthere is no man that can expound it.\\n25Joseph answered: The king's dream is one:\\nGod hath shewn to Pharao what he is about to\\ndo.\\n26The seven beautiful kine, and the seven full\\nears, are seven years of plenty: and both contain\\nthe same meaning of the dream.\\n27And the seven lean and thin kine that came\\nup after them, and the seven thin ears that were\\nblasted with the burning wind, are seven years\\nof famine to come:\\n28Which shall be ful\\x0clled in this order.29Behold, there shall come seven years of\\ngreat plenty in the whole land of Egypt:\\n30After which shall follow other seven years\\nof so great scarcity, that all the abundance before\\nshall be forgotten: for the famine shall consume\\nall the land,\\n31And the greatness of the scarcity shall de-\\nstroy the greatness of the plenty.\\n32And for that thou didst see the second time\\na dream pertaining to the same thing: it is a\\ntoken of the certainty, and that the word of God\\ncometh to pass, and is ful\\x0clled speedily.\\n33Now therefore let the king provide a wise\\nand industrious man, and make him ruler over\\nthe land of Egypt:\\n34That he may appoint overseers over all the\\ncountries: and gather into barns the \\x0cfth part of\\nthe fruits, during the seven fruitful years,\\n35That shall now presently ensue: and let all\\nthe corn be laid up, under Pharao's hands, and\\nbe reserved in the cities.\\n36And let it be in readiness, against the\\nfamine of seven years to come, which shall op-\\npress Egypt, and the land shall not be consumed\\nwith scarcity.\\n37The counsel pleased Pharao, and all his\\nservants.\\n38And he said to them: Can we \\x0cnd such\\nanother man, that is full of the spirit of God?\\n39He said therefore to Joseph: Seeing God\\nhath shewn thee all that thou hast said, can I\\n\\x0cnd one wiser and one like unto thee?\\n40Thou shalt be over my house, and at the\\ncommandment of thy mouth all the people shall\\nobey: only in the kingly throne will I be above\\nthee.\\n41And again Pharao said to Joseph: Behold,\\nI have appointed thee over the whole land of\\nEgypt.\\n42And he took his ring from his own hand,\\nand gave it into his hand: and he put upon him\\na robe of silk, and put a chain of gold about his\\nneck.\\n43And he made him go up into his second\\nchariot, the crier proclaiming that all should bow\\ntheir knee before him, and that they should know\\nhe was made governor over the whole land of\\nEgypt.\\n44And the king said to Joseph: I am Pharao:\\nwithout thy commandment no man shall move\\nhand or foot in all the land of Egypt.\\n45And he turned his name, and called him\\nin the Egyptian tongue the saviour of the world.\\nAnd he gave him to wife Aseneth, the daughter\\nof Putiphare, priest of Heliopolis. Then Joseph\\nwent out to the land of Egypt.\\n46(Now he was thirty years old when he stood\\nbefore king Pharao), and he went round all the\\ncountries of Egypt.\\n47And the fruitfulness of the seven years\\ncame: and the corn being bound up into sheaves,\\nwas gathered together into the barns of Egypt.\\n48And all the abundance of grain was laid up\\nin every city.\\n49And there was so great abundance of\\nwheat, that it was equal to the sand of the sea,\\nand the plenty exceeded measure.\\n50And before the famine came, Joseph had\\ntwo sons born: whom Aseneth, the daughter of\\nPutiphare, priest of Heliopolis, bore unto him.\\n51And he called the name of the \\x0crstborn\\nManasses, saying: God hath made me to forget\\nall my labours, and my father's house.\\n52And he named the second Ephraim, saying:\\nGod hath made me to grow in the land of my\\npoverty.\\n53Now when the seven years of plenty that\\nhad been in Egypt were passed:\\n54The seven years of scarcity, which Josephhad foretold, began to come: and the famine\\nprevailed in the whole world, but there was bread\\nin all the land of Egypt.\\n55And when there also they began to be fam-\\nished, the people cried to Pharao, for food. And\\nhe said to them: Go to Joseph: and do all that\\nhe shall say to you.\\n56And the famine increased daily in all the\\nland: and Joseph opened all the barns, and sold\\nto the Egyptians: for the famine had oppressed\\nthem also.\\n57And all provinces came into Egypt, to buy\\nfood, and to seek some relief of their want.\\nChapter 42\\nAnd Jacob hearing that food was sold in Egypt,\\nsaid to his sons: Why are ye careless?\\n2I have heard that wheat is sold in Egypt:\\nGo ye down, and buy us necessaries, that we\\nmay live, and not be consumed with want.\\n3So the ten brethren of Joseph went down, to\\nbuy corn in Egypt:\\n4Whilst Benjamin was kept at home by Ja-\\ncob, who said to his brethren: Lest perhaps he\\ntake any harm in the journey.\\n5And they entered into the land of Egypt with\\nothers that went to buy. For the famine was in\\nthe land of Chanaan.\\n6And Joseph was governor in the land of\\nEgypt, and corn was sold by his direction to the\\npeople. And when his brethren had bowed down\\nto him,\\n7And he knew them, he spoke as it were\\nto strangers, somewhat roughly, asking them:\\nWhence came you? They answered: From the\\nland of Chanaan, to buy necessaries of life.\\n8And though he knew his brethren, he was\\nnot known by them.\\n9And remembering the dreams, which for-\\nmerly he had dreamed, he said to them: You are\\nspies. You are come to view the weaker parts of\\nthe land.\\n10But they said: It is not so, my lord; but\\nthy servants are come to buy food.\\n11We are all the sons of one man: we are\\ncome as peaceable men, neither do thy servants\\ngo about any evil.\\n12And he answered them: It is otherwise:\\nyou are come to consider the unfenced parts of\\nthis land.\\n13But they said: We thy servants are twelve\\nbrethren, the sons of one man in the land of\\nChanaan: the youngest is with our father, the\\nother is not living.\\n14He saith, This is it that I said: You are\\nspies.\\n15I shall now presently try what you are: by\\nthe health of Pharao, you shall not depart hence,\\nuntil your youngest brother come.\\n16Send one of you to fetch him: and you shall\\nbe in prison, till what you have said be proved,\\nwhether it be true or false: or else by the health\\nof Pharao you are spies.\\n17So he put them in prison three days.\\n18And the third day he brought them out of\\nprison, and said: Do as I have said, and you shall\\nlive: for I fear God.\\n19If you be peaceable men, let one of your\\nbrethren be bound in prison: and go ye your\\nways, and carry the corn that you have bought,\\nunto your houses.\\n20And bring your youngest brother to me,\\nthat I may \\x0cnd your words to be true, and you\\nmay not die. They did as he had said.\\n21And they talked one to another: We de-\\nserve to su\\x0ber these things, because we have\\nsinned against our brother, seeing the anguish\\nof his soul, when he besought us, and we wouldnot hear: therefore is this a\\x0fiction come upon\\nus.\\n22And Ruben, one of them, said: Did not I\\nsay to you: Do not sin against the boy; and you\\nwould not hear me? Behold his blood is required.\\n23And they knew not that Joseph under-\\nstood, because he spoke to them by an inter-\\npreter.\\n24And he turned himself away a little while,\\nand wept: and returning, he spoke to them.\\n25And taking Simeon, and binding him in\\ntheir presence, he commanded his servants to \\x0cll\\ntheir sacks with wheat, and to put every man's\\nmoney again in their sacks, and to give them\\nbesides provisions for the way: and they did so.\\n26But they having loaded their asses with the\\ncorn went their way.\\n27And one of them opening his sack, to give\\nhis beast provender in the inn, saw the money in\\nthe sack's mouth,\\n28And said to his brethren: My money is\\ngiven me again; behold it is in the sack. And\\nthey were astonished, and troubled, and said to\\none another: What is this that God hath done\\nunto us?\\n29And they came to Jacob their father in the\\nland of Chanaan, and they told him all things\\nthat had befallen them, saying:\\n30The lord of the land spoke roughly to us,\\nand took us to be spies of the country.\\n31And we answered him: We are peaceable\\nmen, and we mean no plot.\\n32We are twelve brethren born of one father:\\none is not living, the youngest is with our father\\nin the land of Chanaan.\\n33And he said to us: Hereby shall I know\\nthat you are peaceable men: Leave one of your\\nbrethren with me, and take ye necessary provi-\\nsion for your houses, and go your ways,\\n34And bring your youngest brother to me,\\nthat I may know you are not spies: and you may\\nreceive this man again, that is kept in prison:\\nand afterwards may have leave to buy what you\\nwill.\\n35When they had told this, they poured out\\ntheir corn, and every man found his money tied\\nin the mouth of his sack: and all being aston-\\nished together,\\n36Their father Jacob said: You have made\\nme to be without children: Joseph is not living,\\nSimeon is kept in bonds, and Benjamin you will\\ntake away: all these evils are fallen upon me.\\n37And Ruben answered him: Kill my two\\nsons, if I bring him not again to thee: deliver\\nhim into my hand, and I will restore him to thee.\\n38But he said: My son shall not go down with\\nyou: his brother is dead, and he is left alone:\\nif any mischief befall him in the land to which\\nyou go, you will bring down my grey hairs with\\nsorrow to hell.\\nChapter 43\\nIn the mean time the famine was heavy upon all\\nthe land.\\n2And when they had eaten up all the corn,\\nwhich they had brought out of Egypt, Jacob said\\nto his sons: Go again, and buy us a little food.\\n3Juda answered: The man declared unto us\\nwith the attestation of an oath, saying: You shall\\nnot see my face, unless you bring your youngest\\nbrother with you.\\n4If therefore thou wilt send him with us, we\\nwill set out together, and will buy necessaries for\\nthee.\\n5But if thou wilt not, we will not go: for the\\nman, as we have often said, declared unto us,\\nsaying: You shall not see my face without youryoungest brother.\\n6Israel said to them: You have done this for\\nmy misery, in that you told him you had also\\nanother brother.\\n7But they answered: The man asked us in or-\\nder concerning our kindred: if our father lived:\\nif we had a brother: and we answered him reg-\\nularly, according to what he demanded: could\\nwe know that he would say: Bring hither your\\nbrother with you?\\n8And Juda said to his father: Send the boy\\nwith me, that we may set forward, and may live:\\nlest both we and our children perish.\\n9I take the boy upon me, require him at my\\nhand: unless I bring him again, and restore him\\nto thee, I will be guilty of sin against thee for\\never.\\n10If delay had not been made, we had been\\nhere again the second time.\\n11Then Israel said to them: If it must needs\\nbe so, do what you will: take of the best fruits of\\nthe land in your vessels, and carry down presents\\nto the man, a little balm, and honey, and storax,\\nmyrrh, turpentine, and almonds.\\n12And take with you double money, and carry\\nback what you found in your sacks, lest perhaps\\nit was done by mistake.\\n13And take also your brother, and go to the\\nman.\\n14And may my almighty God make him\\nfavourable to you: and send back with you your\\nbrother, whom he keepeth, and this Benjamin:\\nand as for me I shall be desolate without chil-\\ndren.\\n15So the men took the presents, and dou-\\nble money, and Benjamin: and went down into\\nEgypt, and stood before Joseph.\\n16And when he had seen them, and Benjamin\\nwith them, he commanded the steward of his\\nhouse, saying: Bring in the men into the house,\\nand kill victims, and prepare a feast: because\\nthey shall eat with me at noon.\\n17He did as he was commanded, and brought\\nthe men into the house.\\n18And they being much afraid, said there\\none to another: Because of the money, which\\nwe carried back the \\x0crst time in our sacks, we\\nare brought in: that he may bring upon us a\\nfalse accusation, and by violence make slaves of\\nus and our asses.\\n19Wherefore, going up to the steward of the\\nhouse, at the door,\\n20They said: Sir, we desire thee to hear us.\\nWe came down once before to buy food:\\n21And when we had bought, and were come\\nto the inn, we opened our sacks, and found our\\nmoney in the mouths of the sacks: which we have\\nnow brought again in the same weight.\\n22And we have brought other money besides,\\nto buy what we want: we cannot tell who put it\\nin our bags.\\n23But he answered: Peace be with you, fear\\nnot: your God, and the God of your father, hath\\ngiven you treasure in your sacks. For the money,\\nwhich you gave me, I have for good. And he\\nbrought Simeon out to them.\\n24And having brought them into the house,\\nhe fetched water, and they washed their feet, and\\nhe gave provender to their asses.\\n25But they made ready the presents, against\\nJoseph came at noon: for they had heard that\\nthey should eat bread there.\\n26Then Joseph came in to his house, and they\\no\\x0bered him the presents, holding them in their\\nhands; and they bowed down with their face to\\nthe ground.\\n27But he courteously saluting them again,\\nasked them, saying: Is the old man your father\\nin health, of whom you told me? Is he yet living?28And they answered: Thy servant our fa-\\nther, is in health; he is yet living. And bowing\\nthemselves, they made obeisance to him.\\n29And Joseph lifting up his eyes, saw Ben-\\njamin, his brother by the same mother, and said:\\nIs this your young brother, of whom you told me?\\nAnd he said: God be gracious to thee, my son.\\n30And he made haste, because his heart was\\nmoved upon his brother, and tears gushed out:\\nand going into his chamber, he wept.\\n31And when he had washed his face, coming\\nout again, he refrained himself, and said: Set\\nbread on the table.\\n32And when it was set on, for Joseph apart,\\nand for his brethren apart, for the Egyptians also\\nthat ate with him apart, (for it is unlawful for\\nthe Egyptians to eat with the Hebrews, and they\\nthink such a feast profane):\\n33They sat before him, the \\x0crstborn accord-\\ning to his birthright, and the youngest according\\nto his age. And they wondered very much;\\n34Taking the messes which they received of\\nhim: and the greater mess came to Benjamin, so\\nthat it exceeded by \\x0cve parts. And they drank,\\nand were merry with him.\\nChapter 44\\nAnd Joseph commanded the steward of his\\nhouse, saying: Fill their sacks with corn, as much\\nas they can hold: and put the money of every one\\nin the top of his sack.\\n2And in the mouth of the younger's sack put\\nmy silver cup, and the price which he gave for\\nthe wheat. And it was so done.\\n3And when the morning arose, they were sent\\naway with their asses.\\n4And when they were now departed out of the\\ncity, and had gone forward a little way: Joseph\\nsending for the steward of his house, said: Arise,\\nand pursue after the men: and when thou hast\\novertaken them, say to them: Why have you re-\\nturned evil for good?\\n5The cup which you have stolen, is that in\\nwhich my lord drinketh, and in which he is wont\\nto divine: you have done a very evil thing.\\n6He did as he had commanded him. And\\nhaving overtaken them, he spoke to them the\\nsame words.\\n7And they answered: Why doth our lord\\nspeak so, as though thy servants had commit-\\nted so heinous a fact?\\n8The money, that we found in the top of our\\nsacks, we brought back to thee from the land of\\nChanaan: how then should it be that we should\\nsteal out of thy lord's house, gold or silver?\\n9With whomsoever of thy servants shall be\\nfound that which thou seekest, let him die, and\\nwe will be the bondmen of my lord.\\n10And he said to them: Let it be according\\nto your sentence: with whomsoever it shall be\\nfound, let him be my servant, and you shall be\\nblameless.\\n11Then they speedily took down their sacks\\nto the ground, and every man opened his sack.\\n12Which when he had searched, beginning at\\nthe eldest, and ending at the youngest, he found\\nthe cup in Benjamin's sack.\\n13Then they rent their garments, and loading\\ntheir asses again, returned into the town.\\n14And Juda at the head of his brethren went\\nin to Joseph (for he was not yet gone out of the\\nplace) and they all together fell down before him\\non the ground.\\n15And he said to them: Why would you do\\nso? know you not that there is no one like me in\\nthe science of divining.\\n16And Juda said to him: What shall we an-\\nswer my lord? or what shall we say, or be ablejustly to allege? God hath found out the iniq-\\nuity of thy servants: behold, we are all bondmen\\nto my lord, both we, and he with whom the cup\\nwas found.\\n17Joseph answered: God forbid that I should\\ndo so: he that stole the cup, he shall be my\\nbondman: and go you away free to your father.\\n18Then Juda coming nearer, said boldly: I\\nbeseech thee, my lord, let thy servant speak a\\nword in thy ears, and be not angry with thy ser-\\nvant: for after Pharao thou art.\\n19My lord. Thou didst ask thy servants the\\n\\x0crst time: Have you a father or a brother.\\n20And we answered thee, my lord: We have\\na father an old man, and a young boy, that was\\nborn in his old age; whose brother by the mother\\nis dead; and he alone is left of his mother, and\\nhis father loveth him tenderly.\\n21And thou saidst to thy servants: Bring him\\nhither to me, and I will set my eyes on him.\\n22We suggested to my lord: The boy cannot\\nleave his father: for if he leave him, he will die.\\n23And thou saidst to thy servants: Except\\nyour youngest brother come with you, you shall\\nsee my face no more.\\n24Therefore when we were gone up to thy\\nservant our father, we told him all that my lord\\nhad said.\\n25And our father said: Go again, and buy us\\na little wheat.\\n26And we said to him: We cannot go: if our\\nyoungest brother go down with us, we will set\\nout together: otherwise, without him we dare\\nnot see the man's face.\\n27Whereunto he answered: You know that\\nmy wife bore me two.\\n28One went out, and you said: A beast de-\\nvoured him; and hitherto he appeareth not.\\n29If you take this also, and any thing befall\\nhim in the way, you will bring down my grey\\nhairs with sorrow unto hell.\\n30Therefore, if I shall go to thy servant, our\\nfather, and the boy be wanting, (whereas his life\\ndependeth upon the life of him,)\\n31And he shall see that he is not with us, he\\nwill die, and thy servants shall bring down his\\ngrey hairs with sorrow unto hell.\\n32Let me be thy proper servant, who took\\nhim into my trust, and promised, saying: If I\\nbring him not again, I will be guilty of sin against\\nmy father for ever.\\n33Therefore I, thy servant, will stay instead\\nof the boy in the service of my lord, and let the\\nboy go up with his brethren.\\n34For I cannot return to my father without\\nthe boy, lest I be a witness of the calamity that\\nwill oppress my father.\\nChapter 45\\nJoseph could no longer refrain himself before\\nmany that stood by: whereupon he commanded\\nthat all should go out, and no stranger be present\\nat their knowing one another.\\n2And he lifted up his voice with weeping,\\nwhich the Egyptians, and all the house of Pharao\\nheard.\\n3And he said to his brethren: I am Joseph:\\nIs my father yet living? His brethren could not\\nanswer him, being struck with exceeding great\\nfear.\\n4And he said mildly to them: Come nearer\\nto me. And when they were come near him, he\\nsaid: I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold\\ninto Egypt.\\n5Be not afraid, and let it not seem to you a\\nhard case that you sold me into these countries:\\nfor God sent me before you into Egypt for your\\npreservation.6For it is two years since the famine began to\\nbe upon the land, and \\x0cve years more remain,\\nwherein there can be neither ploughing nor reap-\\ning.\\n7And God sent me before, that you may be\\npreserved upon the earth, and may have food to\\nlive.\\n8Not by your counsel was I sent hither, but\\nby the will of God: who hath made me as it were\\na father to Pharao, and lord of his whole house,\\nand governor in all the land of Egypt.\\n9Make haste, and go ye up to my father, and\\nsay to him: Thus saith thy son Joseph: God hath\\nmade me lord of the whole land of Egypt; come\\ndown to me, linger not.\\n10And thou shalt dwell in the land of Gessen:\\nand thou shalt be near me, thou and thy sons,\\nand thy sons' sons, thy sheep, and thy herds, and\\nall things that thou hast.\\n11And there I will feed thee, (for there are\\nyet \\x0cve years of famine remaining) lest both thou\\nperish, and thy house, and all things that thou\\nhast.\\n12Behold, your eyes, and the eyes of my\\nbrother Benjamin, see that it is my mouth that\\nspeaketh to you.\\n13You shall tell my father of all my glory, and\\nall things that you have seen in Egypt: make\\nhaste and bring him to me.\\n14And falling upon the neck of his brother\\nBenjamin, he embraced him and wept: and Ben-\\njamin in like manner wept also on his neck.\\n15And Joseph kissed all his brethren, and\\nwept upon every one of them: after which they\\nwere emboldened to speak to him.\\n16And it was heard, and the fame was spread\\nabroad in the king's court: The brethren of\\nJoseph are come; and Pharao with all his family\\nwas glad.\\n17And he spoke to Joseph that he should give\\norders to his brethren, saying: Load your beasts,\\nand go into the land of Chanaan,\\n18And bring away from thence your father\\nand kindred, and come to me; and I will give\\nyou all the good things of Egypt, that you may\\neat the marrow of the land.\\n19Give orders also that they take wagons out\\nof the land of Egypt, for the carriage of their\\nchildren and their wives; and say: Take up your\\nfather, and make haste to come with all speed:\\n20And leave nothing of your household stu\\x0b;\\nfor all the riches of Egypt shall be yours.\\n21And the sons of Israel did as they were\\nbid. And Joseph gave them wagons according to\\nPharao's commandment: and provisions for the\\nway.\\n22He ordered also to be brought out for every\\none of them two robes: but to Benjamin he gave\\nthree hundred pieces of silver, with \\x0cve robes of\\nthe best:\\n23Sending to his father as much money and\\nraiment; adding besides, ten he asses, to carry o\\x0b\\nall the riches of Egypt, and as many she asses,\\ncarrying wheat and bread for the journey.\\n24So he sent away his brethren, and at their\\ndeparting said to them: Be not angry in the way.\\n25And they went up out of Egypt, and came\\ninto the land of Chanaan, to their father Jacob.\\n26And they told him, saying: Joseph, thy\\nson, is living; and he is ruler in all the land of\\nEgypt. Which when Jacob heard, he awaked as\\nit were out of a deep sleep, yet did not believe\\nthem.\\n27They, on the other side, told the whole\\norder of the thing. And when he saw the wagons,\\nand all that he had sent, his spirit revived,\\n28And he said: It is enough for me if Joseph,\\nmy son, be yet living: I will go and see him before\\nI die.Chapter 46\\nAnd Israel taking his journey, with all that he\\nhad, came to the well of the oath, and killing\\nvictims there to the God of his father Isaac,\\n2He heard him, by a vision in the night, call-\\ning him, and saying to him: Jacob, Jacob. And\\nhe answered him: Lo, here I am.\\n3God said to him: I am the most mighty God\\nof thy father; fear not, go down into Egypt, for\\nI will make a great nation of thee there.\\n4I will go down with thee thither, and will\\nbring thee back again from thence: Joseph also\\nshall put his hands upon thy eyes.\\n5And Jacob rose up from the well of the oath:\\nand his sons took him up, with their children and\\nwives in the wagons, which Pharao had sent to\\ncarry the old man,\\n6And all that he had in the land of Chanaan:\\nand he came into Egypt with all his seed;\\n7His sons, and grandsons, daughters, and all\\nhis o\\x0bspring together.\\n8And these are the names of the children of\\nIsrael, that entered into Egypt, he and his chil-\\ndren. His \\x0crstborn Ruben,\\n9The sons of Ruben: Henoch and Phallu, and\\nHesron and Charmi.\\n10The sons of Simeon: Jamuel and Jamin\\nand Ahod, and Jachin and Sohar, and Saul, the\\nson of a woman of Chanaan.\\n11The sons of Levi: Gerson and Caath, and\\nMerari.\\n12The sons of Juda: Her and Onan, and Sela,\\nand Phares and Zara. And Her and Onan died\\nin the land of Chanaan. And sons were born to\\nPhares: Hesron and Hamul.\\n13The sons of Issachar: Thola and Phua, and\\nJob and Semron.\\n14The sons of Zabulon: Sared, and Elon, and\\nJahelel.\\n15These are the sons of Lia, whom she bore in\\nMesopotamia of Syria, with Dina, his daughter.\\nAll the souls of her sons and daughters, thirty-\\nthree.\\n16The sons of Gad: Sephion and Haggi, and\\nSuni and Esebon, and Heri and Arodi, and Areli.\\n17The sons of Aser: Jamne and Jesua, and\\nJessuri and Beria, and Sara their sister. The\\nsons of Beria: Heber and Melchiel.\\n18These are the sons of Zelpha, whom Laban\\ngave to Lia, his daughter. And these she bore to\\nJacob, sixteen souls.\\n19The sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife: Joseph\\nand Benjamin.\\n20And sons were born to Joseph, in the\\nland of Egypt, whom Aseneth, the daughter of\\nPutiphare, priest of Heliopolis, bore him: Man-\\nasses and Ephraim.\\n21The sons of Benjamin: Bela and Bechor,\\nand Asbel and Gera, and Naaman and Echi, and\\nRoss and Mophim, and Ophim and Ared.\\n22These are the sons of Rachel, whom she\\nbore to Jacob: all the souls, fourteen.\\n23The sons of Dan: Husim.\\n24The sons of Nephthali: Jaziel and Guni,\\nand Jeser and Sallem.\\n25These are the sons of Bala, whom Laban\\ngave to Rachel, his daughter: and these she bore\\nto Jacob: all the souls, seven.\\n26All the souls that went with Jacob into\\nEgypt, and that came out of his thigh, besides\\nhis sons' wives, sixty-six.\\n27And the sons of Joseph, that were born to\\nhim in the land of Egypt, two souls. All the souls\\nof the house of Jacob, that entered into Egypt,\\nwere seventy.\\n28And he sent Juda before him to Joseph, to\\ntell him; and that he should meet him in Gessen.\\n29And when he was come thither, Joseph\\nmade ready his chariot, and went up to meethis father in the same place: and seeing him, he\\nfell upon his neck, and embracing him, wept.\\n30And the father said to Joseph: Now shall\\nI die with joy, becuase I have seen thy face, and\\nleave thee alive.\\n31And Joseph said to his brethren, and to\\nall his father's house: I will go up, and will\\ntell Pharao, and will say to him: My brethren,\\nand my father's house, that were in the land of\\nChanaan, are come to me:\\n32And the men are shepherds, and their oc-\\ncupation is to feed cattle; their \\rocks, and herds,\\nand all they have, they have brought with them.\\n33And when he shall call you, and shall say:\\nWhat is your occupation?\\n34You shall answer: We, thy servants, are\\nshepherds, from our infancy until now, both we\\nand our fathers. And this you shall say, that\\nyou may dwell in the land of Gessen, because the\\nEgyptians have all shepherds in abomination.\\nChapter 47\\nThen Joseph went in and told Pharao, saying:\\nMy father and brethren, their sheep and their\\nherds, and all that they possess, are come out of\\nthe land of Chanaan: and behold they stay in\\nthe land of Gessen.\\n2Five men also, the last of his brethren, he\\npresented before the king:\\n3And he asked them: What is your occu-\\npation? They answered: We, thy servants, are\\nshepherds, both we and our fathers.\\n4We are come to sojourn in thy land, because\\nthere is no grass for the \\rocks of thy servants,\\nthe famine being very grievous in the land of\\nChanaan: and we pray thee to give orders that\\nwe thy servants may be in the land of Gessen.\\n5The king therefore said to Joseph: Thy fa-\\nther and thy brethren are come to thee.\\n6The land of Egypt is before thee: and make\\nthem dwell in the best place, and give them the\\nland of Gessen. And if thou knowest that there\\nare industrious men among them, make them\\nrulers over my cattle.\\n7After this Joseph brought in his father to\\nthe king, and presented him before him: and he\\nblessed him.\\n8And being asked by him: How many are the\\ndays of the years of thy life?\\n9He answered: The days of my pilgrimage\\nare a hundred and thirty years, few, and evil,\\nand they are not come up to the days of the\\npilgrimage of my fathers.\\n10And blessing the king, he went out.\\n11But Joseph gave a possession to his fa-\\nther and his brethren in Egypt, in the best place\\nof the land, in Ramesses, as Pharao had com-\\nmanded.\\n12And he nourished them, and all his father's\\nhouse, allowing food to every one.\\n13For in the whole world there was want\\nof bread, and a famine had oppressed the land,\\nmore especially of Egypt and Chanaan;\\n14Out of which he gathered up all the money\\nfor the corn which they bought, and brought it\\nin to the king's treasure.\\n15And when the buyers wanted money, all\\nEgypt came to Joseph, saying: Give us bread:\\nwhy should we die in thy presence, having now\\nno money?\\n16And he answered them: Bring me your cat-\\ntle, and for them I will give you food, if you have\\nno money.\\n17And when they had brought them, he gave\\nthem food in exchange for their horses, and\\nsheep, and oxen, and asses: and he maintained\\nthem that year for the exchange of their cattle.18And they came the second year, and said\\nto him: We will not hide from our lord, how that\\nour money is spent, and our cattle also are gone:\\nneither art thou ignorant that we have nothing\\nnow left but our bodies and our lands.\\n19Why therefore shall we die before thy eyes?\\nwe will be thine, both we and our lands: buy\\nus to be the king's servants, and give us seed,\\nlest for want of tillers the land be turned into a\\nwilderness.\\n20So Joesph bought all the land of Egypt,\\nevery man selling his possessions, because of the\\ngreatness of the famine. And he brought it into\\nPharao's hands:\\n21And all its people from one end of the bor-\\nders of Egypt, even to the other end thereof,\\n22Except the land of the priests, which had\\nbeen given them by the king: to whom also a\\ncertain allowance of food was given out of the\\npublic stores, and therefore they were not forced\\nto sell their possessions.\\n23Then Joseph said to the people: Behold,\\nas you see, both you and your lands belong to\\nPharao; take seed and sow the \\x0celds,\\n24That you may have corn. The \\x0cfth part\\nyou shall give to the king; the other four you\\nshall have for seed, and for food for your families\\nand children.\\n25And they answered: our life is in thy hand;\\nonly let my lord look favourably upon us, and we\\nwill gladly serve the king.\\n26From that time unto this day, in the whole\\nland of Egypt, the \\x0cfth part is paid to the kings,\\nand it is become as a law, except the land of the\\npriests, which was free from this covenant.\\n27So Israel dwelt in Egypt, that is, in the\\nland of Gessen, and possessed it; and grew, and\\nwas multiplied exceedingly.\\n28And he lived in it seventeen years: and all\\nthe days of his life came to a hundred and forty-\\nseven years.\\n29And when he saw that the day of his death\\ndrew nigh, he called his son Joseph, and said\\nto him: If I have found favour in thy sight, put\\nthy hand under my thigh; and thou shalt shew\\nme this kindness and truth, not to bury me in\\nEgypt.\\n30But I will sleep with my fathers, and thou\\nshalt take me away out of this land, and bury\\nme in the burying place of my ancestors. And\\nJoseph answered him: I will do what thou hast\\ncommanded.\\n31And he said: Swear then to me. And as he\\nwas swearing, Israel adored God, turning to the\\nbed's head.\\nChapter 48\\nAfter these things, it was told Joseph that his\\nfather was sick; and he set out to go to him,\\ntaking his two sons Manasses and Ephraim.\\n2And it was told the old man: Behold thy son\\nJoseph cometh to thee. And being strengthened,\\nhe sat on his bed.\\n3And when Joseph was come in to him, he\\nsaid: God almighty apppeared to me at Luza,\\nwhich is in the land of Chanaan, and he blessed\\nme,\\n4And said: I will cause thee to increase and\\nmultiply, and I will make of thee a multitude of\\npeople: and I will give this land to thee, and to\\nthy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.\\n5So thy two sons, who were born to thee in\\nthe land of Egypt before I came hither to thee,\\nshall be mine: Ephraim and Manasses shall be\\nreputed to me as Ruben and Simeon.\\n6But the rest whom thou shalt have after\\nthem, shall be thine, and shall be called by the\\nname of their brethren in their possessions.7For, when I came out of Mesopotamia,\\nRachel died from me in the land of Chanaan in\\nthe very journey, and it was spring time: and I\\nwas going to Ephrata, and I buried her near the\\nway of Ephrata, which by another name is called\\nBethlehem.\\n8Then seeing his sons, he said to him: Who\\nare these?\\n9He answered: They are my sons, whom God\\nhath given me in this place. And he said: Bring\\nthem to me, that I may bless them.\\n10For Israel's eyes were dim by reason of his\\ngreat age, and he could not see clearly. And\\nwhen they were brought to him, he kissed and\\nembraced them,\\n11And said to his son: I am not deprived of\\nseeing thee; moreover God hath shewn me thy\\nseed.\\n12And when Joseph had taken them from his\\nfather's lap, he bowed down with his face to the\\nground.\\n13And he set Ephraim on his right hand, that\\nis, towards the left hand of Israel; but Manasses\\non his left hand, to wit, towards his father's right\\nhand, and brought them near to him.\\n14But he, stretching forth his right hand,\\nput it upon the head of Ephraim, the younger\\nbrother; and the left upon the head of Manasses,\\nwho was the elder, changing his hands.\\n15And Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph, and\\nsaid: God, in whose sight my fathers Abraham\\nand Isaac walked, God that feedeth me from my\\nyouth until this day:\\n16The angel that delivereth me from all evils,\\nbless these boys: and let my name be called upon\\nthem, and the names of my fathers Abraham and\\nIsaac; and may they grow into a multitude upon\\nthe earth.\\n17And Joseph seeing that his father had put\\nhis right hand upon the head of Ephraim, was\\nmuch displeased: and taking his father's hand,\\nhe tried to lift it from Ephraim's head, and to\\nremove it to the head of Manasses.\\n18And he said to his father: It should not be\\nso, my father; for this is the \\x0crstborn, put thy\\nright hand upon his head.\\n19But he refusing, said: I know, my son, I\\nknow: and this also shall become a people, and\\nshall be multiplied; but his younger brother shall\\nbe greater than he; and his seed shall grow into\\nnations.\\n20And he blessed them at that time, saying:\\nIn thee shall Israel be blessed, and it shall be\\nsaid: God do to thee as to Ephraim, and as to\\nManasses. And he set Ephraim before Manasses.\\n21And he said to Joseph, his son: Behold I\\ndie, and God will be with you, and will bring\\nyou back into the land of your fathers.\\n22I give thee a portion above thy brethren,\\nwhich I took out of the hand of the Amorrhite\\nwith my sword and bow.\\nChapter 49\\nAnd Jacob called his sons, and said to them:\\nGather yourselves together, that I may tell you\\nthe things that shall befall you in the last days.\\n2Gather yourselves together, and hear, O ye\\nsons of Jacob, hearken to Israel, your father:\\n3Ruben, my \\x0crstborn, thou art my strength,\\nand the beginning of my sorrow; excelling in\\ngifts, greater in command.\\n4Thou art poured out as water, grow thou\\nnot; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed,\\nand didst de\\x0cle his couch.\\n5Simeon and Levi brethren: vessels of iniq-\\nuity waging war.\\n6Let not my soul go into their counsel, nor\\nmy glory be in their assembly: because in theirfury they slew a man, and in their selfwill they\\nundermined a wall.\\n7Cursed be their fury, because it was stub-\\nborn: and their wrath, because it was cruel: I\\nwill divide them in Jacob, and will scatter them\\nin Israel.\\n8Juda, thee shall thy brethren praise: thy\\nhand shall be on the necks of thy enemies; the\\nsons of thy father shall bow down to thee.\\n9Juda is a lion's whelp: to the prey, my son,\\nthou art gone up: resting thou hast couched as\\na lion, and as a lioness, who shall rouse him?\\n10The sceptre shall not be taken away from\\nJuda, nor a ruler from his thigh, till he come that\\nis to be sent, and he shall be the expectation of\\nnations.\\n11Tying his foal to the vineyard, and his ass,\\nO my son, to the vine. He shall wash his robe in\\nwine, and his garment in the blood of the grape.\\n12His eyes are more beautiful than wine, and\\nhis teeth whiter than milk.\\n13Zabulon shall dwell on the seashore, and in\\nthe road of ships, reaching as far as Sidon.\\n14Issachar shall be a strong ass, lying down\\nbetween the borders.\\n15He saw rest that it was good: and the land\\nthat it was excellent: and he bowed his shoulder\\nto carry, and became a servant under tribute.\\n16Dan shall judge his people like another\\ntribe in Israel.\\n17Let Dan be a snake in the way, a serpent\\nin the path, that biteth the horse's heels, that\\nhis rider may fall backward.\\n18I will look for thy salvation, O Lord.\\n19Gad, being girded, shall \\x0cght before him:\\nand he himself shall be girded backward.\\n20Aser, his bread shall be fat, and he shall\\nyield dainties to kings.\\n21Nephthali, a hart let loose, and giving\\nwords of beauty.\\n22Joseph is a growing son, a growing son and\\ncomely to behold: the daughters run to and fro\\nupon the wall;\\n23But they that held darts, provoked him,\\nand quarrelled with him, and envied him.\\n24His bow rested upon the strong, and the\\nbands of his arms and his hands were loosed, by\\nthe hands of the mighty one of Jacob: thence he\\ncame forth a pastor, the stone of Israel.\\n25The God of thy father shall be thy helper,\\nand the Almighty shall bless thee with the bless-\\nings of heaven above, with the blessings of the\\ndeep that lieth beneath, with the blessings of the\\nbreasts and of the womb.\\n26The blessings of thy father are strength-\\nened with the blessings of his fathers: until the\\ndesire of the everlasting hills should come: may\\nthey be upon the head of Joseph, and upon the\\ncrown of the Nazarite among his brethren.\\n27Benjamin a ravenous wolf, in the morning\\nshall eat the prey, and in the evening shall divide\\nthe spoil.\\n28All these are the twelve tribes of Israel:\\nthese things their father spoke to them, and he\\nblessed every one with their proper blessings.\\n29And he charged them, saying: I am now\\ngoing to be gathered to my people: bury me with\\nmy fathers in the double cave, which is in the\\n\\x0celd of Ephron the Hethite,\\n30Over against Mambre, in the land of\\nChanaan, which Abraham bought together with\\nthe \\x0celd, of Ephron the Hethite, for a possession\\nto bury in.\\n31There they buried him, and Sara his wife:\\nthere was Isaac buried with Rebecca, his wife:\\nthere also Lia doth lie buried.\\n32And when he had ended the command-\\nments, wherewith he instructed his sons, he drew\\nup his feet upon the bed, and died: and he was\\ngathered to his people.Chapter 50\\nAnd when Joseph saw this, he fell upon his fa-\\nther's face, weeping and kissing him.\\n2And he commanded his servants, the physi-\\ncians, to embalm his father.\\n3And while they were ful\\x0clling his commands,\\nthere passed forty days: for this was the man-\\nner with bodies that were embalmed, and Egypt\\nmourned for him seventy days.\\n4And the time of the mourning being expired,\\nJoseph spoke to the family of Pharao: If I have\\nfound favour in your sight, speak in the ears of\\nPharao:\\n5For my father made me swear to him, saying:\\nBehold I die; thou shalt bury me in my sepulchre\\nwhich I have digged for myself in the land of\\nChanaan. So I will go up and bury my father,\\nand return.\\n6And Pharao said to him: Go up and bury\\nthy father according as he made thee swear.\\n7So he went up, and there went with him all\\nthe ancients of Pharao's house, and all the elders\\nof the land of Egypt.\\n8And the house of Joseph with his brethren,\\nexcept their children, and their \\rocks and herds,\\nwhich they left in the land of Gessen.\\n9He had also in his train chariots and horse-\\nmen: and it was a great company.\\n10And they came to the threshing \\roor\\nof Atad, which is situated beyond the Jordan:\\nwhere celebrating the exequies with a great and\\nvehement lamentation, they spent full seven\\ndays.\\n11And when the inhabitants of Chanaan saw\\nthis, they said: This is a great mourning to the\\nEgyptians. And therefore the name of that place\\nwas called, The mourning of Egypt.\\n12So the sons of Jacob did as he had com-\\nmanded them.\\n13And carrying him into the land of\\nChanaan, they buried him in the double cave,\\nwhich Abraham had bought together with the\\n\\x0celd for a possession of a burying place, of Eh-\\npron, the Hethite, over against Mambre.\\n14And Joseph returned into Egypt with his\\nbrethren, and all that were in his company, after\\nhe had buried his father.\\n15Now he being dead, his brethren were\\nafraid, and talked one with another: Lest per-\\nhaps he should remember the wrong he su\\x0bered,\\nand requite us all the evil that we did to him.\\n16And they sent a message to him, saying:\\nThy father commanded us before he died,\\n17That we should say thus much to thee from\\nhim: I beseech thee to forget the wickedness of\\nthy brethren, and the sin and malice they prac-\\ntised against thee: we also pray thee, to forgive\\nthe servants of the God of thy father this wicked-\\nness. And when Joseph heard this, he wept.\\n18And his brethren came to him; and wor-\\nshipping prostrate on the ground, they said: We\\nare thy servants.\\n19And he answered them: Fear not: can we\\nresist the will of God?\\n20You thought evil against me: but God\\nturned it into good, that he might exalt me, as\\nat present you see, and might save many people.\\n21Fear not: I will feed you and your children.\\nAnd he comforted them, and spoke gently and\\nmildly.\\n22And he dwelt in Egypt with all his father's\\nhouse; and lived a hundred and ten years. And\\nhe saw the children of Ephraim to the third gen-\\neration. The children also of Machir, the sons of\\nManasses, were born on Joseph's knees.\\n23After which he told his brethren: God will\\nvisit you after my death, and will make you go\\nup out of this land, to the land which he swore\\nto Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.24And he made them swear to him, saying:\\nGod will visit you, carry my bones with you out\\nof this place:\\n25And he died, being a hundred and ten years\\nold. And being embalmed, he was laid in a co\\x0en\\nin Egypt.\\n\""

And\\nthe fourth river is Euphrates.\\n15And the Lord God took man, and put him\\ninto the paradise of pleasure, to dress it, and to\\nkeep it.\\n16And he commanded him, saying: Of every\\ntree of paradise thou shalt eat:\\n17But of the tree of knowledge of good and\\nevil, thou shalt not eat. For in what day soever\\nthou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.\\n18And the Lord God said: It is not good for\\nman to be alone: let us make him a help like\\nunto himself.\\n19And the Lord God having formed out of\\nthe ground all the beasts of the earth, and all\\nthe fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to see\\nwhat he would call them: for whatsoever Adam\\ncalled any living creature the same is its name.\\n20And Adam called all the beasts by their\\nnames, and all the fowls of the air, and all the\\ncattle of the \\x0celd: but for Adam there was not\\nfound a helper like himself.\\n21Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon\\nAdam: and when he was fast asleep, he took one\\nof his ribs, and \\x0clled up \\resh for it.\\n22And the Lord God built the rib which he\\ntook from Adam into a woman: and brought her\\nto Adam.\\n23And Adam said: This now is bone of my\\nbones, and \\resh of my \\resh; she shall be called\\nwoman, because she was taken out of man.\\n24Wherefore a man shall leave father and\\nmother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they\\nshall be two in one \\resh.\\n25And they were both naked: to wit, Adam\\nand his wife: and were not ashamed.Chapter 3\\nNow the serpent was more subtle tha any of the\\nbeasts of the earth which the Lord God had\\nmade. And he said to the woman: Why hath\\nGod commanded you, that you should not eat\\nof every tree of paradise?\\n2And the woman answered him, saying: Of\\nthe fruit of the trees that are in paradise we do\\neat:\\n3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the\\nmidst of paradise, God hath commanded us that\\nwe should not eat; and that we should not touch\\nit, lest perhaps we die.\\n4And the serpent said to the woman: No, you\\nshall not die the death.\\n5For God doth know that in what day soever\\nyou shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened:\\nand you shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.\\n6And the woman saw that the tree was good\\nto eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to\\nbehold: and she took of the fruit thereof, and\\ndid eat, and gave to her husband, who did eat.\\n7And the eyes of them both were opened:\\nand when they perceived themselves to be naked,\\nthey sewed together \\x0cg leaves, and made them-\\nselves aprons.\\n8And when they heard the voice of the Lord\\nGod walking in paradise at the afternoon air,\\nAdam and his wife hid themselves from the face\\nof the Lord God, amidst the trees of paradise.\\n9And the Lord God called Adam, and said to\\nhim: Where art thou?\\n10And he said: I heard thy voice in paradise;\\nand I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid\\nmyself.\\n11And he said to him: And who hath told\\nthee that thou wast naked, but that thou hast\\neaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that\\nthou shouldst not eat?\\n12And Adam said: The woman, whom thou\\ngavest me to be my companion, gave me of the\\ntree, and I did eat.\\n13And the Lord God said to the woman: Why\\nhast thou done this? And she answered: The\\nserpent deceived me, and I did eat.\\n14And the Lord God said to the serpent: Be-\\ncause thou hast done this thing, thou art cursed\\namong all cattle, and beasts of the earth: upon\\nthy breast shalt thou go, and earth shalt thou\\neat all the days of thy life.\\n15I will put enmities between thee and the\\nwoman, and thy seed and her seed: she shall\\ncursh thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her\\nheel.\\n16To the woman also he said: I will multi-\\nply thy sorrows, and thy conceptions: in sorrow\\nshalt thou bring forth children, and thou shalt\\nbe under thy husband's power, and he shall have\\ndominion over thee.\\n17And to Adam he said: Because thou hast\\nhearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten\\nof the tree, whereof I commanded thee, that thou\\nshouldst not eat, cursed is the earth in thy work:\\nwith labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the\\ndays of thy life.\\n18Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to\\nthee, and thou shalt eat the herbs of the earth.\\n19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread\\ntill thou return to the earth out of which thou\\nwast taken: for dust thou art, and into dust thou\\nshalt return.\\n20And Adam called the name of his wife Eve:\\nbecause she was the mother of all the living.\\n21And the Lord God made for Adam and his\\nwife garments of skins, and clothed them.\\n22And he said: Behold Adam is become as\\none of us, knowing good and evil: now therefore\\nlest perhaps he put forth his hand and take also\\nof the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.23And the Lord God sent him out of the par-\\nadise of pleasure, to till the earth from which he\\nwas taken.\\n24And he cast out Adam: and placed before\\nthe paradise of pleasure Cherubims, and a \\ram-\\ning sword, turning every way, to keep the way of\\nthe tree of life.\\nChapter 4\\nAnd Adam knew Eve his wife; who conceived\\nand brought forth Cain, saying: I have gotten a\\nman through God.\\n2And again she brought forth his brother\\nAbel. And Abel was a shepherd, and Cain a\\nhusbandman.\\n3And it came to pass after many days, that\\nCain o\\x0bered, of the fruits of the earth, gifts to\\nthe Lord.\\n4Abel also o\\x0bered of the \\x0crstlings of his \\rock,\\nand of their fat: and the Lord had respect to\\nAbel, and to his o\\x0berings.\\n5But to Cain and his o\\x0berings he had no re-\\nspect: and Cain was exceeding angry, and his\\ncountenance fell.\\n6And the Lord said to him: Why art thou\\nangry? and why is thy countenance fallen?\\n7If thou do well, shalt thou not receive? but\\nif ill, shall not sin forthwith be present at the\\ndoor? but the lust thereof shall be under thee,\\nand thou shalt have dominion over it.\\n8And Cain said to Abel his brother: Let us go\\nforth abroad. And when they were in the \\x0celd,\\nCain rose up against his brother Abel, and slew\\nhim.\\n9And the Lord said to Cain: Where is thy\\nbrother Abel? And he answered: I know not:\\nam I my brother's keeper?\\n10And he said to him: What hast thou done?\\nthe voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from\\nthe earth.\\n11Now therefore cursed shalt thou be upon\\nthe earth, which hath opened her mouth and re-\\ncieved the blood of thy brother at thy hand.\\n12When thou shalt till it, it shall not yield\\nto thee its fruit: a fugitive and a vagabond shalt\\nthou be upon the earth.\\n13And Cain said to the Lord: My iniquity is\\ngreater than that I may deserve pardon.\\n14Behold thou dost cast me out this day from\\nthe face of the earth, and from thy face I shall be\\nhid, and I shall be a vagabond and a fugitive on\\nthe earth: every one therefore that \\x0cndeth me,\\nshall kill me.\\n15And the Lord said to him: No, it shall\\nnot so be: but whosoever shall kill Cain, shall\\nbe punished sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark\\nupon Cain, that whosoever found him should not\\nkill him.\\n16And Cain went out from the face of the\\nLord, and dwelt as a fugitive on the earth at the\\neast side of Eden.\\n17And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived,\\nand brought forth Henoch: and he built a city,\\nand called the name thereof by the name of his\\nson Henoch.\\n18And Henoch begot Irad, and Irad be-\\ngot Maviael, and Maviael begot Mathusael, and\\nMathusael begot Lamech,\\n19Who took two wives: the name of the one\\nwas Ada, and the name of the other Sella.\\n20And Ada brought forth Jabel: who was the\\nfather of such as dwell in tents, and of herdsmen.\\n21And his brother's name was Jubal: he was\\nthe father of them that play upon the harp and\\nthe organs.\\n22Sella also brought forth Tubalcain, who\\nwas a hammerer and arti\\x0ccer in every work ofbrass and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was\\nNoema.\\n23And Lamech said to his wives Ada and\\nSella: Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hear-\\nken to my speech: for I have slain a man to the\\nwounding of myself, and a stripling to my own\\nbruising.\\n24Sevenfold vengeance shall be taken for\\nCain: but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold.\\n25Adam also knew his wife again: and she\\nbrought forth a son, and called his name Seth,\\nsaying: God hath given me another seed for\\nAbel, whom Cain slew.\\n26But to Seth also was born a son, whom\\nhe called Enos: this man began to call upon the\\nname of the Lord.\\nChapter 5\\nThis is the book of the generation of Adam. In\\nthe day that God created man, he made him to\\nthe likeness of God.\\n2He created them male and female; and\\nblessed them: and called their name Adam, in\\nthe day when they were created.\\n3And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years,\\nand begot a son to his own image and likeness,\\nand called his name Seth.\\n4And the days of Adam, after he begot Seth,\\nwere eight hundred years: and he begot sons and\\ndaughters.\\n5And all the time that Adam lived, came to\\nnine hundred and thirty years, and he died.\\n6Seth also lived a hundred and \\x0cve years, and\\nbegot Enos.\\n7And Seth lived after he begot Enos, eight\\nhundred and seven years, and begot sons and\\ndaughters.\\n8And all the days of Seth were nine hundred\\nand twelve years, and he died.\\n9And Enos lived ninety years, and begot\\nCainan.\\n10After whose birth he lived eight hundred\\nand \\x0cfteen years, and begot sons and daughters.\\n11And all the days of Enos were nine hundred\\nand \\x0cve years, and he died.\\n12And Cainan lived seventy years, and begot\\nMalaleel.\\n13And Cainan lived after he begot Malaleel,\\neight hundred and forty years, and begot sons\\nand daughters.\\n14And all the days of Cainan were nine hun-\\ndred and ten years, and he died.\\n15And Malaleel lived sixty-\\x0cve years and be-\\ngot Jared.\\n16And Malaleel lived after he begot Jared,\\neight hundred and thirty years, and begot sons\\nand daughters.\\n17And all the days of Malaleel were eight\\nhundred and ninety-\\x0cve years, and he died.\\n18And Jared lived a hundred and sixty-two\\nyears, and begot Henoch.\\n19And Jared lived after he begot Henoch,\\neight hundred years, and begot sons and daugh-\\nters.\\n20And all the days of Jared were nine hun-\\ndred and sixty-two years, and he died.\\n21And Henoch lived sixty-\\x0cve years, and be-\\ngot Mathusala.\\n22And Henoch walked with God: and lived\\nafter he begot Mathusala, three hundred years,\\nand begot sons and daughters.\\n23And all the days of Henoch were three hun-\\ndred and sixty-\\x0cve years.\\n24And he walked with God, and was seen no\\nmore: because God took him.\\n25And Mathusala lived a hundred and eighty-\\nseven years, and begot Lamech.26And Mathlusala lived after he begot\\nLamech, seven hundred and eighty-two years,\\nand begot sons and daughters.\\n27And all the days of Mathusala were nine\\nhundred and sixty-nine years, and he died.\\n28And Lamech lived a hundred and eighty-\\ntwo years, and begot a son.\\n29And he called his name Noe, saying:\\nThis same shall comfort us from the works and\\nlabours of our hands on the earth, which the\\nLord hath cursed.\\n30And Lamech lived after he begot Noe, \\x0cve\\nhundred and ninety-\\x0cve years, and begot sons\\nand daughters.\\n31And all the days of Lamech came to seven\\nhundred and seventy-seven years, and he died.\\nAnd Noe, when he was \\x0cve hundred years old,\\nbegot Sem, Cham, and Japheth.\\nChapter 6\\nAnd after that men began to be multiplied upon\\nthe earth, and daughters were born to them,\\n2The sons of God seeing the daughters of\\nmen, that they were fair, took to themselves\\nwives of all which they chose.\\n3And God said: My spirit shall not remain\\nin man for ever, because he is \\resh, and his days\\nshall be a hundred and twenty years.\\n4Now giants were upon the earth in those\\ndays. For after the sons of God went in to the\\ndaughters of men, and they brought forth chil-\\ndren, these are the mighty men of old, men of\\nrenown.\\n5And God seeing that the wickedness of men\\nwas great on the earth, and that all the thought\\nof their heart was bent upon evil at all times,\\n6It repented him that he had made man on\\nthe earth.

Noe therefore understood that the\\nwaters were ceased upon the earth.\\n12And he stayed yet other seven days: and\\nhe sent forth the dove, which returned not any\\nmore unto him.\\n13Therefore in the six hundredth and \\x0crst\\nyear, the \\x0crst month, the \\x0crst day of the month,\\nthe waters were lessened upon the earth, and\\nNoe opening the covering of the ark, looked, and\\nsaw that the face of the earth was dried.\\n14In the second month, the seven and twen-\\ntieth day of the month, the earth was dried.\\n15And God spoke to Noe, saying:\\n16Go out of the ark, thou and thy wife, thy\\nsons and the wives of thy sons with thee.\\n17All living things that are with thee of all\\n\\resh, as well in fowls as in beasts, and all creep-\\ning things that creep upon the earth, bring out\\nwith thee, and go ye upon the earth: increase\\nand multiply upon it.\\n18So Noe went out, he and his sons: his wife,\\nand the wives of his sons with him.\\n19And all living things, and cattle, and creep-\\ning things that creep upon the earth, according\\nto their kinds went out of the ark.20And Noe built an altar unto the Lord: and\\ntaking of all cattle and fowls that were clean,\\no\\x0bered holocausts upon the altar.\\n21And the Lord smelled a sweet savour, and\\nsaid: I will no more curse the earth for the sake of\\nman: for the imagination and thought of man's\\nheart are prone to evil from his youth: therefore\\nI will no more destroy every living soul as I have\\ndone.\\n22All the days of the earth, seedtime and har-\\nvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, night\\nand day, shall not cease.\\nChapter 9\\nAnd God blessed Noe and his sons. And he\\nsaid to them: Increase, and multiply, and \\x0cll the\\nearth.\\n2And let the fear and dread of you be upon\\nall the beasts of the earth, and upon all the fowls\\nof the air, and all that move upon the earth: all\\nthe \\x0cshes of the sea are delivered into your hand.\\n3And every thing that moveth, and liveth\\nshall be meat for you: even as the green herbs\\nhave I delivered them all to you:\\n4Saving that \\resh with blood you shall not\\neat.\\n5For I will require the blood of your lives at\\nthe hand of every beast, and at the hand of man,\\nat the hand of every man, and of his brother, will\\nI require the life of man.\\n6Whosoever shall shed man's blood, his blood\\nshall be shed: for man was made to the image of\\nGod.\\n7But increase you and multiply, and go upon\\nthe earth and \\x0cll it.\\n8Thus also said God to Noe, and to his sons\\nwith him:\\n9Behold I will establish my covenant with\\nyou, and with your seed after you:\\n10And with every living soul that is with you,\\nas well in all birds, as in cattle and beasts of the\\nearth, that are come forth out of the ark, and in\\nall the beasts of the earth.\\n11I will establish my covenant with you, and\\nall \\resh shall be no more destroyed with the wa-\\nters of a \\rood, neither shall there be from hence-\\nforth a \\rood to waste the earth.\\n12And God said: This is the sign of the\\ncovenant which I give between me and you, and\\nto every living soul that is with you, for perpet-\\nual generations.\\n13I will set my bow in the clouds, and it shall\\nbe the sign of a covenant between me and be-\\ntween the earth.\\n14And when I shall cover the sky with clouds,\\nmy bow shall appear in the clouds:\\n15And I will remember my covenant with\\nyou, and with every living soul that beareth\\n\\resh: and there shall no more be waters of a\\n\\rood to destroy all \\resh.\\n16And the bow shall be in the clouds, and I\\nshall see it, and shall remember the everlasting\\ncovenant, that was made between God and every\\nliving soul of all \\resh which is upon the earth.\\n17And God said to Noe: This shall be the\\nsign of the covenant, which I have established,\\nbetween me and all \\resh upon the earth.\\n18And the sons of Noe, who came out of the\\nark, were Sem, Cham, and Japheth: and Cham\\nis the father of Chanaan.\\n19These three are the sons of Noe: and from\\nthese was all mankind spread over the whole\\nearth.\\n20And Noe a husbandman began to till the\\nground, and planted a vineyard.\\n21And drinking of the wine was made drunk,\\nand was uncovered in his tent.22Which when Cham the father of Chanaan\\nhad seen, to wit, that his father's nakedness was\\nuncovered, he told it to his two brethren without.\\n23But Sem and Japheth put a cloak upon\\ntheir shoulders, and going backward, covered the\\nnakedness of their father: and their faces were\\nturned away, and they saw not their father's\\nnakedness.\\n24And Noe awaking from the wine, when he\\nhad learned what his younger son had done to\\nhim,\\n25He said: Cursed be Chanaan, a servant of\\nservants shall he be unto his brethren.\\n26And he said: Blessed be the Lord God of\\nSem, be Chanaan his servant.\\n27May God enlarge Japheth, and may he\\ndwell in the tents of Sem, and Chanaan be his\\nservant.\\n28And Noe lived after the \\rood three hun-\\ndred and \\x0cfty years.\\n29And all his days were in the whole nine\\nhundred and \\x0cfty years: and he died.\\nChapter 10\\nThese are the generations of the sons of Noe:\\nSem, Cham, and Japheth: and unto them sons\\nwere born after the \\rood.\\n2The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog,\\nand Madai, and Javan, and Thubal, and Mosoch,\\nand Thiras.\\n3And the sons of Gomer: Ascenez and\\nRiphath and Thogorma.\\n4And the sons of Javan: Elisa and Tharsis,\\nCetthim and Dodanim.\\n5By these were divided the islands of the Gen-\\ntiles in their lands, every one according to his\\ntongue and their families in their nations.\\n6And the Sons of Cham: Chus, and Mesram,\\nand Phuth, and Chanaan.\\n7And the sons of Chus: Saba, and Hevila,\\nand Sabatha, and Regma, and Sabatacha. The\\nsons of Regma: Saba, and Dadan.\\n8Now Chus begot Nemrod: he began to be\\nmighty on the earth.\\n9And he was a stout hunter before the Lord.\\nHence came a proverb: Even as Nemrod the\\nstout hunter before the Lord.\\n10And the beginning of his kingdom was\\nBabylon, and Arach, and Achad, and Chalanne\\nin the land of Sennaar.\\n11Out of that land came forth Assur, and\\nbuilt Ninive, and the streets of the city, and\\nChale.\\n12Resen also between Ninive and Chale: this\\nis the great city.\\n13And Mesraim begot Ludim, and Anamim\\nand Laabim, Nephthuim.\\n14And Phetrusim, and Chasluim; of whom\\ncame forth the Philistines, and the Capthorim.\\n15And Chanaan begot Sidon his \\x0crstborn,\\nthe Hethite,\\n16And the Jebusite, and the Amorrhite, and\\nthe Gergesite.\\n17The Hevite and Aracite: the Sinite,\\n18And the Aradian, the Samarite, and the\\nHamathite: and afterwards the families of the\\nChanaanites were spread abroad.\\n19And the limits of Chanaan were from Sidon\\nas one comes to Gerara even to Gaza, until thou\\nenter Sodom and Gomorrha, and Adama, and\\nSeboim even to Lesa.\\n20These are the children of Cham in their kin-\\ndreds and tongues, and generations, and lands,\\nand nations.\\n21Of Sem also the father of all the children of\\nHeber, the elder brother of Japheth, sons were\\nborn.22The sons of Sem: Elam and Assur, and\\nArphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.\\n23The sons of Aram: Us, and Hull, and\\nGether; and Mes.\\n24But Arphaxad begot Sale, of whom was\\nborn Heber.\\n25And to Heber were born two sons: the\\nname of the one was Phaleg, because in his days\\nwas the earth divided: and his brother's name\\nJectan.\\n26Which Jectan begot Elmodad, and Saleph,\\nand Asarmoth, Jare,\\n27And Aduram, and Uzal, and Decla,\\n28And Ebal, and Abimael, Saba,\\n29And Ophir, and Hevila, and Jobab. All\\nthese were the sons of Jectan.\\n30And their dwelling was from Messa as we\\ngo on as far as Sephar, a mountain in the east.\\n31These are the children of Sem according\\nto their kindreds and tongues, and countries in\\ntheir nations.\\n32These are the families of Noe, according\\nto their people and nations. By these were the\\nnations divided on the earth after the \\rood.\\nChapter 11\\nAnd the earth was of one tongue, and of the same\\nspeech.\\n2And when they removed from the east, they\\nfound a plain in the land of Sennaar, and dwelt\\nin it.\\n3And each one said to his neighbour: Come\\nlet us make brick, and bake them with \\x0cre. And\\nthey had brick instead of stones, and slime in-\\nstead of mortar:\\n4And they said: Come, let us make a city and\\na tower, the top whereof may reach to heaven;\\nand let us make our name famous before we be\\nscattered abroad into all lands.\\n5And the Lord came down to see the city\\nand the tower, which the children of Adam were\\nbuilding.\\n6And he said: Behold, it is one people, and all\\nhave one tongue: and they have begun to do this,\\nneither will they leave o\\x0b from their designs, till\\nthey accomplish them in deed.\\n7Come ye, therefore, let us go down, and\\nthere confound their tongue, that they may not\\nunderstand one another's speech.\\n8And so the Lord scattered them from that\\nplace into all lands, and they ceased to build the\\ncity.\\n9And therefore the name thereof was called\\nBabel, because there the language of the whole\\nearth was confounded: and from thence the Lord\\nscattered them abroad upon the face of all coun-\\ntries.\\n10These are the generations of Sem: Sem was\\na hundred years old when he begot Arphaxad,\\ntwo years after the \\rood.\\n11And Sem lived after he begot Arphaxad,\\n\\x0cve hundred years, and begot sons and daugh-\\nters.\\n12And Arphaxad lived thirty-\\x0cve years, and\\nbegot Sale.\\n13And Arphaxad lived after he begot Sale,\\nthree hundred and three years, and begot sons\\nand daughters.\\n14Sale also lived thirty years, and begot\\nHeber.\\n15And Sale lived after he begot Heber, four\\nhundred and three years: and begot sons and\\ndaughters.\\n16And Heber lived thirty-four years, and be-\\ngot Phaleg.\\n17And Heber lived after he begot Phaleg, four\\nhundred and thirty years: and begot sons anddaughters.\\n18Phaleg also lived thirty years, and begot\\nReu.\\n19And Phaleg lived after he begot Reu, two\\nhundred and nine years, and begot sons and\\ndaughters.\\n20And Reu lived thirty-two years, and begot\\nSarug.\\n21And Reu lived after he begot Sarug, two\\nhundred and seven years, and begot sons and\\ndaughters.\\n22And Sarug lived thirty years, and begot\\nNachor.\\n23And Sarug lived after he begot Nachor, two\\nhundred years, and begot sons and daughters.\\n24And Nachor lived nine and twenty years,\\nand begot Thare.\\n25And Nachor lived after he begot Thare, a\\nhundred and nineteen years, and begot sons and\\ndaughters.\\n26And Thare lived seventy years, and begot\\nAbram, and Nachor, and Aran.\\n27And these are the generations of Thare:\\nThare begot Abram, Nachor, and Aran. And\\nAran begot Lot.\\n28And Aran died before Thare his father, in\\nthe land of his nativity in Ur of the Chaldees.\\n29And Abram and Nachor married wives: the\\nname of Abram's wife was Sarai: and the name\\nof Nachor's wife, Melcha, the daughter of Aran,\\nfather of Melcha and father of Jescha.\\n30And Sarai was barren, and had no children.\\n31And Thare took Abram his son, and Lot\\nthe son of Aran, his son's son, and Sarai his\\ndaughter in law, the wife of Abram his son, and\\nbrought them out of Ur of the Chaldees, to go\\ninto the land of Chanaan: and they came as far\\nas Haran, and dwelt there.\\n32And the days of Thare were two hundred\\nand \\x0cve years, and he died in Haran.\\nChapter 12\\nAnd the Lord said to Abram: Go forth out of\\nthy country, and from thy kindred, and out of\\nthy father's house, and come into the land which\\nI shall shew thee.\\n2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I\\nwill bless thee, and magnify thy name, and thou\\nshalt be blessed.\\n3I will bless them that bless thee, and curse\\nthem that curse thee, and IN THEE shall all the\\nkindreds of the earth be blessed.\\n4So Abram went out as the Lord had com-\\nmanded him, and Lot went with him: Abram\\nwas seventy-\\x0cve years old when he went forth\\nfrom Haran.\\n5And he took Sarai his wife, and Lot his\\nbrother's son, and all the substance which they\\nhad gathered, and the souls which they had got-\\nten in Haran: and they went out to go into the\\nland of Chanaan. And when they were come into\\nit,\\n6Abram passed through the country unto the\\nplace of Sichem, as far as the noble vale: now\\nthe Chanaanite was at that time in the land.\\n7And the Lord appeared to Abram, and said\\nto him: To thy seed will I give this land. And\\nhe built there an altar to the Lord, who had ap-\\npeared to him.\\n8And passing on from thence to a mountain,\\nthat was on the east side of Bethel, he there\\npitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and\\nHai on the east: he built there also an altar to\\nthe Lord, and called upon his name.\\n9And Abram went forward, going and pro-\\nceeding on to the south.\\n10And there came a famine in the country:\\nand Abram went down into Egypt, to sojourn\\nthere: for the famine was very grievous in the\\nland.11And when he was near to enter into Egypt,\\nhe said to Sarai his wife: I know that thou art a\\nbeautiful woman:\\n12And that when the Egyptians shall see\\nthee, they will say: She is his wife: and they\\nwill kill me, and keep thee.\\n13Say, therefore, I pray thee, that thou art\\nmy sister: that I may be well used for thee, and\\nthat my soul may live for thy sake.\\n14And when Abram was come into Egypt,\\nthe Egyptians saw the woman that she was very\\nbeautiful.\\n15And the princes told Pharao, and praised\\nher before him: and the woman was taken into\\nthe house of Pharao.\\n16And they used Abram well for her sake.\\nAnd he had sheep and oxen and he asses, and\\nmen servants, and maid servants, and she asses,\\nand camels.\\n17But the Lord scourged Pharao and his\\nhouse with most grievous stripes for Sarai,\\nAbram's wife.\\n18And Pharao called Abram, and said to him:\\nWhat is this that thou hast done to me? Why\\ndidst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?\\n19For what cause didst thou say, she was thy\\nsister, that I might take her to my wife? Now\\ntherefore there is thy wife, take her, and go thy\\nway.\\n20And Pharao gave his men orders concern-\\ning Abram: and they led him away and his wife,\\nand all that he had.\\nChapter 13\\nAnd Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his\\nwife, and all that he had, and Lot with him into\\nthe south.\\n2And he was very rich in possession of gold\\nand silver.\\n3And he returned by the way, that he came,\\nfrom the south to Bethel, to the place where be-\\nfore he had pitched his tent between Bethel and\\nHai,\\n4In the place of the altar which he had made\\nbefore, and there he called upon the name of the\\nLord.\\n5But Lot also, who was with Abram, had\\n\\rocks of sheep, and herds of beasts, and tents.\\n6Neither was the land able to bear them, that\\nthey might dwell together: for their substance\\nwas great, and they could not dwell together.\\n7Whereupon also there arose a strife between\\nthe herdsmen of Abram and of Lot. And at that\\ntime the Chanaanite and the Pherezite dwelled\\nin that country.\\n8Abram therefore said to Lot: Let there be\\nno quarrel, I beseech thee, between me and thee,\\nand between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen:\\nfor we are brethren.\\n9Behold the whole land is before thee: depart\\nfrom me, I pray thee: if thou wilt go to the left\\nhand, I will take the right: if thou choose the\\nright hand, I will pass to the left.\\n10And Lot lifting up his eyes, saw all the\\ncountry about the Jordan, which was watered\\nthroughout, before the Lord destroyed Sodom\\nand Gomorrha, as the paradise of the Lord, and\\nlike Egypt as one comes to Segor.\\n11And Lot chose to himself the country about\\nthe Jordan, and he departed from the east: and\\nthey were separated one brother from the other.\\n12Abram dwelt in the land of Chanaan: and\\nLot abode in the towns, that were about the Jor-\\ndan, and dwelt in Sodom.\\n13And the men of Sodom were very wicked,\\nand sinners before the face of the Lord beyond\\nmeasure.14And the Lord said to Abram, after Lot\\nwas separated from him: Lift up thy eyes, and\\nlook from the place wherein thou now art, to the\\nnorth and to the south, to the east and to the\\nwest.\\n15All the land which thou seest, I will give to\\nthee, and to thy seed for ever.\\n16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the\\nearth: if any man be able to number the dust of\\nthe earth, he shall be able to number thy seed\\nalso.\\n17Arise and walk through the land in the\\nlength, and the breadth thereof: for I will give it\\nto thee.\\n18So Abram removing his tent, came, and\\ndwelt by the vale of Mambre, which is in Hebron:\\nand he built there an altar to the Lord.\\nChapter 14\\nAnd it came to pass at that time, that Amraphel,\\nking of Sennaar, and Arioch, king of Pontus,\\nand Chodorlahomor, king of the Elamites, and\\nThadal, king of nations,\\n2Made war against Bara, king of Sodom, and\\nagainst Bersa, king of Gomorrha, and against\\nSennaab, king of Adama, and against Semeber,\\nking of Seboim, and against the king of Bala,\\nwhich is Segor.\\n3All these came together into the woodland\\nvale, which now is the salt sea.\\n4For they had served Chodorlahomor twelve\\nyears, and in the thirteenth year they revolted\\nfrom him.\\n5And in the fourteenth year came Chodorla-\\nhomor, and the kings that were with him: and\\nthey smote the Raphaim in Astarothcarnaim,\\nand the Zuzim with them, and the Emim in Save\\nof Cariathaim.\\n6And the Chorreans in the mountains of Seir,\\neven to the plains of Pharan, which is in the\\nwilderness.\\n7And they returned, and came to the foun-\\ntain of Misphat, the same is Cades: and they\\nsmote all the country of the Amalecites, and the\\nAmorrhean that dwelt in Asasonthamar.\\n8And the king of Sodom, and the king of Go-\\nmorrha, and the king of Adama, and the king\\nof Seboim, and the king of Bala, which is Segor,\\nwent out: and they set themselves against them\\nin battle array, in the woodland vale:\\n9To wit, against Chodorlahomor king of the\\nElamites, and Thadal king of nations, and Am-\\nraphel king of Sennaar, and Arioch king of Pon-\\ntus: four kings against \\x0cve.\\n10Now the woodland vale had many pits of\\nslime. And the king of Sodom, and the king\\nof Gomorrha turned their backs, and were over-\\nthrown there: and they that remained, \\red to\\nthe mountain.\\n11And they took all the substance of the\\nSodomites, and Gomorrhites, and all their vict-\\nuals, and went their way:\\n12And Lot also, the son of Abram's brother,\\nwho dwelt in Sodom, and his substance.\\n13And behold one, that had escaped, told\\nAbram the Hebrew, who dwelt in the vale of\\nMambre the Amorrhite, the brother of Escol,\\nand the brother of Aner: for these had made\\na league with Abram.\\n14Which when Abram had heard, to wit, that\\nhis brother Lot was taken, he numbered of the\\nservants born in his house, three hundred and\\neighteen, well appointed: and pursued them to\\nDan.\\n15And dividing his company, he rushed upon\\nthem in the night, and defeated them: and pur-\\nsued them as far as Hoba, which is on the left\\nhand of Damascus.16And he brought back all the substance, and\\nLot his brother, with his substance, the women\\nalso, and the people.\\n17And the king of Sodom went out to meet\\nhim, after he returned from the slaughter of\\nChodorlahomor, and of the kings that were with\\nhim in the vale of Save, which is the king's vale.\\n18But Melchisedech, the king of Salem, bring-\\ning forth bread and wine, for he was the priest\\nof the most high God,\\n19Blessed him, and said: Blessed be Abram\\nby the most high God, who created heaven and\\nearth.\\n20And blessed be the most high God, by\\nwhose protection, the enemies are in thy hands.\\nAnd he gave him the tithes of all.\\n21And the king of Sodom said to Abram:\\nGive me the persons, and the rest take to thyself.\\n22And he answered him: I lift up my hand\\nto the Lord God the most high, the possessor of\\nheaven and earth,\\n23That from the very woofthread unto the\\nshoe latchet, I will not take of any things that\\nare thine, lest thou say: I have enriched Abram.\\n24Except such things as the young men have\\neaten, and the shares of the men that came with\\nme, Aner, Escol, and Mambre: these shall take\\ntheir shares.\\nChapter 15\\nNow when these things were done, the word of\\nthe Lord came to Abram by a vision, saying:\\nFear not, Abram, I am thy protector, and thy\\nreward exceeding great.\\n2And Abram said: Lord God, what wilt thou\\ngive me? I shall go without children: and the\\nson of the steward of my house is this Damascus\\nEliezer.\\n3And Abram added: But to me thou hast not\\ngiven seed: and lo my servant born in my house,\\nshall be my heir.\\n4And immediately the word of the Lord came\\nto him, saying : He shall not be thy heir: but\\nhe that shall come out of thy bowels, him shalt\\nthou have for thy heir.\\n5And he brought him forth abroad, and said\\nto him: Look up to heaven and number the stars\\nif thou canst. And he said to him: So shall thy\\nseed be.\\n6Abram believed God, and it was reputed to\\nhim unto justice.\\n7And he said to him: I am the Lord who\\nbrought thee out from Ur of the Chaldees, to give\\nthee this land, and that thou mightest possess it.\\n8But he said: Lord God, whereby may I know\\nthat I shall possess it?\\n9And the Lord answered, and said: Take me\\na cow of three years old, and a she goat of three\\nyears. and a ram of three years, a turtle also,\\nand a pigeon.\\n10And he took all these, and divided them\\nin the midst, and laid the two pieces of each one\\nagainst the other: but the birds he divided not.\\n11And the fowls came down upon the car-\\ncasses, and Abram drove them away.\\n12And when the sun was setting, a deep sleep\\nfell upon Abram, and a great and darksome hor-\\nror seized upon him.\\n13And it was said unto him: Know thou be-\\nforehand that thy seed shall be a stranger in a\\nland not their own, and they shall bring them\\nunder bondage, and a\\x0fict them four hundred\\nyears.\\n14But I will judge the nation which they shall\\nserve, and after this they shall come out with\\ngreat substance.\\n15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace,\\nand be buried in a good old age.16But in the fourth generation they shall re-\\nturn hither: for as yet the iniquities of the Amor-\\nrhites are not at the full until this present time.\\n17And when the sun was set, there arose a\\ndark mist, and there appeared a smoking fur-\\nnace, and a lamp of \\x0cre passing between those\\ndivisions.\\n18That day God made a covenant with\\nAbram, saying: To thy seed will I give this land,\\nfrom the river to Egypt even to the great river\\nEuphrates.\\n19The Cineans, and Cenezites, the Ced-\\nmonites,\\n20And the Hethites, and the Pherezites, the\\nRaphaim also,\\n21And the Amorrhites, and the Chanaanites,\\nand the Gergesites, and the Jebusites.\\nChapter 16\\nNow Sarai, the wife of Abram, had brought forth\\nno children: but having a handmaid, an Egyp-\\ntian, named Agar,\\n2She said to her husband: Behold, the Lord\\nhath restrained me from bearing: go in unto my\\nhandmaid, it may be I may have children of her\\nat least. And when he agreed to her request,\\n3She took Agar the Egyptian her handmaid,\\nten years after they \\x0crst dwelt in the land of\\nChanaan, and gave her to her husband to wife.\\n4And he went in to her. But she perceiving\\nthat she was with child, despised her mistress.\\n5And Sarai said to Abram: Thou dost un-\\njustly with me: I gave my handmaid into thy bo-\\nsom, and she perceiving herself to be with child,\\ndespiseth me. The Lord judge between me and\\nthee.\\n6And Abram made answer, and said to her:\\nBehold thy handmaid is in thy own hand, use\\nher as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai a\\x0ficted\\nher, she ran away.\\n7And the angel of the Lord having found her,\\nby a fountain of water in the wilderness, which\\nis in the way to Sur in the desert,\\n8He said to her: Agar, handmaid of Sarai,\\nwhence comest thou? and whither goest thou?\\nAnd she answered: I \\ree from the face of Sarai,\\nmy mistress.\\n9And the angel of the Lord said to her: Re-\\nturn to thy mistress, and humble thyself under\\nher hand.\\n10And again he said: I will multiply thy seed\\nexceedingly, and it shall not be numbered for\\nmultitude.\\n11And again: Behold, said he, thou art with\\nchild, and thou shalt bring forth a son: and thou\\nshalt call his name Ismael, because the Lord hath\\nheard thy a\\x0fiction.\\n12He shall be a wild man: his hand will be\\nagainst all men, and all men's hands against him:\\nand he shall pitch his tents over against all his\\nbrethren.\\n13And she called the name of the Lord that\\nspoke unto her: Thou the God who hast seen\\nme. For she said: Verily, here have I seen the\\nhinder parts of him that seeth me.\\n14Therefore she called that well, the well of\\nhim that liveth and seeth me. The same is be-\\ntween Cades and Barad.\\n15And Agar brought forth a son to Abram:\\nwho called his name Ismael.\\n16Abram was four score and six years old\\nwhen Agar brought him forth Ismael.\\nChapter 17\\nAnd after he began to be ninety and nine years\\nold, the Lord appeared to him: and said untohim: I am the Almighty God: walk before me,\\nand be perfect.\\n2And I will make my covenant between me\\nand thee: and I will multiply thee exceedingly.\\n3Abram fell \\rat on his face.\\n4And God said to him: I am, and my\\ncovenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a fa-\\nther of many nations.\\n5Neither shall thy name be called any more\\nAbram: but thou shalt be called Abraham: be-\\ncause I have made thee a father of many nations.\\n6And I will make thee increase exceedingly,\\nand I will make nations of thee, and kings shall\\ncome out of thee.\\n7And I will establish my covenant between\\nme and thee, and between thy seed after thee in\\ntheir generations, by a perpetual covenant: to\\nbe a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee.\\n8And I will give to thee, and to thy seed,\\nthe land of thy sojournment, all the land of\\nChanaan, for a perpetual possession, and I will\\nbe their God.\\n9Again God said to Abraham: And thou\\ntherefore shalt keep my covenant, and thy seed\\nafter thee in their generations.\\n10This is my covenant which you shall ob-\\nserve between me and you, and thy seed after\\nthee: All the male kind of you shall be circum-\\ncised.\\n11And you shall circumcise the \\resh of your\\nforeskin, that it may be for a sign of the covenant\\nbetween me and you.\\n12An infant of eight days old shall be circum-\\ncised among you, every manchild in your genera-\\ntions: he that is born in the house, as well as the\\nbought servant, shall be circumcised, and whoso-\\never is not of your stock:\\n13And my covenant shall be in your \\resh for\\na perpetual covenant.\\n14The male whose \\resh of his foreskin shall\\nnot be circumcised, that soul shall be destroyed\\nout of his people: because he hath broken my\\ncovenant.\\n15God said also to Abraham: Sarai thy wife\\nthou shalt not call Sarai, but Sara.\\n16And I will bless her, and of her I will give\\nthee a son, whom I will bless, and he shall be-\\ncome nations, and kings of people shall spring\\nfrom him.\\n17Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed,\\nsaying in his heart: Shall a son, thinkest thou,\\nbe born to him that is a hundred years old? and\\nshall Sara that is ninety years old bring forth?\\n18And he said to God: O that Ismael may\\nlive before thee.\\n19And God said to Abraham: Sara thy wife\\nshall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his\\nname Isaac, and I will establish my covenant\\nwith him for a perpetual covenant, and with his\\nseed after him.\\n20And as for Ismael I have also heard thee.\\nBehold, I will bless him, and increase, and multi-\\nply him exceedingly: he shall beget twelve chiefs,\\nand I will make him a great nation.\\n21But my covenant I will establish with Isaac,\\nwhom Sara shall bring forth to thee at this time\\nin the next year.\\n22And when he had left o\\x0b speaking with\\nhim, God went up from Abraham.\\n23And Abraham took Ismael his son, and\\nall that were born in his house: and all whom\\nhe had bought, every male among the men of\\nhis house: and he circumcised the \\resh of their\\nforeskin forthwith the very same day, as God had\\ncommanded him.\\n24Abraham was ninety and nine years old,\\nwhen he circumcised the \\resh of his foreskin.\\n25And Ismael his son was full thirteen years\\nold at the time of his circumcision.26The selfsame day was Abraham circum-\\ncised and Ismael his son.\\n27And all the men of his house, as well they\\nthat were born in his house, as the bought ser-\\nvants and strangers, were circumcised with him.\\nChapter 18\\nAnd the Lord appeared to him in the vale of\\nMambre as he was sitting at the door of his tent,\\nin the very heat of the day.\\n2And when he had lifted up his eyes, there\\nappeared to him three men standing near to him:\\nand as soon as he saw them, he ran to meet them\\nfrom the door of his tent, and adored down to\\nthe ground.\\n3And he said: Lord, if I have found favour in\\nthy sight, pass not away from thy servant.\\n4But I will fetch a little water, and wash ye\\nyour feet, and rest ye under the tree.\\n5And I will set a morsel of bread, and\\nstrengthen ye your heart, afterwards you shall\\npass on: for therefore are you come aside to your\\nservant. And they said: Do as thou hast spoken.\\n6Abraham made haste into the tent to Sara,\\nand said to her: Make haste, temper together\\nthree measures of \\rour, and make cakes upon\\nthe hearth.\\n7And he himself ran to the herd, and took\\nfrom thence a calf, very tender and very good,\\nand gave it to a young man, who made haste and\\nboiled it.\\n8He took also butter and milk, and the calf\\nwhich he had boiled, and set before them: but\\nhe stood by them under the tree.\\n9And when they had eaten, they said to him:\\nWhere is Sara thy wife? He answered: Lo she is\\nin the tent.\\n10And he said to him: I will return and come\\nto thee at this time, life accompanying, and Sara,\\nthy wife, shall have a son. Which when Sara\\nheard, she laughed behind the door of the tent.\\n11Now they were both old, and far advanced\\nin years, and it had ceased to be with Sara after\\nthe manner of women.\\n12And she laughed secretly, saying: After I\\nam grown old, and my lord is an old man, shall\\nI give myself to pleasure?\\n13And the Lord said to Abraham: Why did\\nSara laugh, saying: Shall I, who am an old\\nwoman, bear a child indeed?\\n14Is there any thing hard to God? According\\nto appointment I will return to thee at this same\\ntime, life accompanying, and Sara shall have a\\nson.\\n15Sara denied, saying: I did not laugh: for\\nshe was afraid. But the Lord said: Nay; but thou\\ndidst laugh.\\n16And when the men rose up from thence,\\nthey turned their eyes towards Sodom: and\\nAbraham walked with them, bringing them on\\nthe way.\\n17And the Lord said: Can I hide from Abra-\\nham what I am about to do:\\n18Seeing he shall become a great and mighty\\nnation, and in him all the nations of the earth\\nshall be blessed?\\n19For I know that he will command his chil-\\ndren, and his household after him, to keep the\\nway of the Lord, and do judgment and justice:\\nthat for Abraham's sake, the Lord may bring to\\ne\\x0bect all the things he hath spoken unto him.\\n20And the Lord said: The cry of Sodom and\\nGomorrha is multiplied, and their sin is become\\nexceedingly grievous.\\n21I will go down and see whether they have\\ndone according to the cry that is come to me; or\\nwhether it be not so, that I may know.\\n22And they turned themselves from thence,and went their way to Sodom: but Abraham as\\nyet stood before the Lord.\\n23And drawing nigh, he said: Wilt thou de-\\nstroy the just with the wicked?\\n24If there be \\x0cfty just men in the city, shall\\nthey perish withal? and wilt thou not spare that\\nplace for the sake of the \\x0cfty just, if they be\\ntherein?\\n25Far be it from thee to do this thing, and to\\nslay the just with the wicked, and for the just to\\nbe in like case as the wicked; this is not beseem-\\ning thee: thou who judgest all the earth, wilt not\\nmake this judgment.\\n26And the Lord said to him: If I \\x0cnd in\\nSodom \\x0cfty just within the city, I will spare the\\nwhole place for their sake.\\n27And Abraham answered, and said: See-\\ning I have once begun, I will speak to my Lord,\\nwhereas I am dust and ashes.\\n28What if there be \\x0cve less than \\x0cfty just\\npersons? wilt thou for \\x0cve and forty destroy the\\nwhole city: And he said: I will not destroy it, if\\nI \\x0cnd \\x0cve and forty.\\n29And again he said to him: But if forty be\\nfound there, what wilt thou do? He said: I will\\nnot destroy it for the sake of forty.\\n30Lord, saith he, be not angry, I beseech thee,\\nif I speak: What if thirty shall be found there?\\nHe answered: I will not do it, if I \\x0cnd thirty\\nthere.\\n31Seeing, saith he, I have once begun, I will\\nspeak to my Lord: What if twenty be found\\nthere? He said: I will not destroy it for the sake\\nof twenty.\\n32I beseech thee, saith he, be not angry, Lord,\\nif I speak yet once more: What if ten shall be\\nfound there? And he said: I will not destroy it\\nfor the sake of ten.\\n33And the Lord departed, after he had left\\nspeaking to Abraham: and Abraham returned\\nto his place.\\nChapter 19\\nAnd the two angels came to Sodom in the\\nevening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of the\\ncity. And seeing them, he rose up and went\\nto meet them: and worshipped prostrate to the\\nground.\\n2And said: I beseech you, my lords, turn in\\nto the house of your servant, and lodge there:\\nwash your feet, and in the morning you shall go\\non your way. And they said: No, but we will\\nabide in the street.\\n3He pressed them very much to turn in unto\\nhim: and when they were come into his house, he\\nmade them a feast, and baked unleavened bread,\\nand they ate:\\n4But before they went to bed, the men of the\\ncity beset the house, both young and old, all the\\npeople together.\\n5And they called Lot, and said to him: Where\\nare the men that came in to thee at night? bring\\nthem out hither, that we may know them:\\n6Lot went out to them, and shut the door\\nafter him, and said:\\n7Do not so, I beseech you, my brethren, do\\nnot commit this evil.\\n8I have two daughters who, as yet, have not\\nknown man; I will bring them out to you, and\\nabuse you them as it shall please you, so that\\nyou do no evil to these men, because they are\\ncome in under the shadow of my roof.\\n9But they said: Get thee back thither. And\\nagain: Thou camest in, said they, as a stranger,\\nwas it to be a judge? therefore we will a\\x0fict\\nthee more than them. And they pressed very\\nviolently upon Lot: and they were even at the\\npoint of breaking open the doors.10And behold the men put out their hand,\\nand drew in Lot unto them, and shut the door.\\n11And them, that were without, they struck\\nwith blindness from the least to the greatest, so\\nthat they could not \\x0cnd the door.\\n12And they said to Lot: Hast thou here any\\nof thine? son in law, or sons, or daughters, all\\nthat are thine bring them out of this city:\\n13For we will destroy this place, because their\\ncry is grown loud before the Lord, who hath sent\\nus to destroy them.\\n14So Lot went out, and spoke to his sons\\nin law that were to have his daughters, and said:\\nArise: get you out of this place, because the Lord\\nwill destroy this city. And he seemed to them to\\nspeak as it were in jest.\\n15And when it was morning, the angels\\npressed him, saying: Arise, take thy wife, and\\nthe two daughters that thou hast: lest thou also\\nperish in the wickedness of the city.\\n16And as he lingered, they took his hand, and\\nthe hand of his wife, and of his two daughters,\\nbecause the Lord spared him.\\n17And they brought him forth, and set him\\nwithout the city: and there they spoke to him,\\nsaying: Save thy life: look not back, neither stay\\nthou in all the country about: but save thy self\\nin the mountain, lest thou be also consumed.\\n18And Lot said to them: I beseech thee, my\\nLord,\\n19Because thy servant hath found grace be-\\nfore thee, and thou hast magni\\x0ced thy mercy,\\nwhich thou hast shewn to me, in saving my life,\\nand I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some\\nevil seize me, and I die.\\n20There is this city here at hand, to which I\\nmay \\ree, it is a little one, and I shall be saved in\\nit: is it not a little one, and my soul shall live?\\n21And he said to him: Behold also in this, I\\nhave heard thy prayers, not to destroy the city\\nfor which thou hast spoken.\\n22Make haste, and be saved there: because\\nI cannot do any thing till thou go in thither.\\nTherefore the name of that city was called Segor.\\n23The sun was risen upon the earth, and Lot\\nentered into Segor.\\n24And the Lord rained upon Sodom and Go-\\nmorrha brimstone and \\x0cre from the Lord out of\\nheaven.\\n25And he destroyed these cities, and all the\\ncountry about, all the inhabitants of the cities,\\nand all things that spring from the earth.\\n26And his wife looking behind her, was\\nturned into a statue of salt.\\n27And Abraham got up early in the morning,\\nand in the place where he had stood before with\\nthe Lord:\\n28He looked towards Sodom and Gomorrha,\\nand the whole land of that country: and he saw\\nthe ashes rise up from the earth as the smoke of\\na furnace.\\n29Now when God destroyed the cities of that\\ncountry, remembering Abraham, he delivered\\nLot out of the destruction of the cities wherein\\nhe had dwelt.\\n30And Lot went up out of Segor, and abode\\nin the mountain, and his two daughters with him\\n(for he was afraid to stay in Segor) and he dwelt\\nin a cave, he and his two daughters with him.\\n31And the elder said to the younger: Our\\nfather is old, and there is no man left on the\\nearth, to come in unto us after the manner of\\nthe whole earth.\\n32Come, let us make him drunk with wine,\\nand let us lie with him, that we may preserve\\nseed of our father.\\n33And they made their father drink wine that\\nnight: and the elder went in, and lay with her\\nfather: but he perceived not, neither when his\\ndaughter lay down, nor when she rose up.34And the next day the elder said to the\\nyounger: Behold I lay last night with my father,\\nlet us make him drink wine also to night, and\\nthou shalt lie with him, that we may save seed\\nof our father.\\n35They made their father drink wine that\\nnight also, and the younger daughter went in,\\nand lay with him: and neither then did he per-\\nceive when she lay down, nor when she rose up.\\n36So the two daughters of Lot were with child\\nby their father.\\n37And the elder bore a son, and she called\\nhis name Moab: he is the father of the Moabites\\nunto this day.\\n38The younger also bore a son, and she called\\nhis name Ammon; that is, the son of my people:\\nhe is the father of the Ammonites unto this day.\\nChapter 20\\nAbraham removed from thence to the south\\ncountry, and dwelt between Cades and Sur, and\\nsojourned in Gerara.\\n2And he said of Sara his wife: She is my sister.\\nSo Abimelech the king of Gerara sent, and took\\nher.\\n3And God came to Abimelech in a dream by\\nnight, and he said to him: Lo thou shalt die for\\nthe woman that thou hast taken: for she hath a\\nhusband.\\n4Now Abimelech had not touched her, and\\nhe said: Lord, wilt thou slay a nation that is\\nignorant and just?\\n5Did not he say to me: She is my sister: and\\nshe say, He is my brother? in the simplicity of\\nmy heart, and cleanness of my hands have I done\\nthis.\\n6And God said to him: And I know that\\nthou didst it with a sincere heart: and therefore\\nI withheld thee from sinning against me, and I\\nsu\\x0bered thee not to touch her.\\n7Now therefore restore the man his wife, for\\nhe is a prophet: and he shall pray for thee, and\\nthou shalt live: but if thou wilt not restore her,\\nknow that thou shalt surely die, thou and all\\nthat are thine.\\n8And Abimelech forthwith rising up in the\\nnight, called all his servants: and spoke all these\\nwords in their hearing, and all the men were ex-\\nceedingly afraid.\\n9And Abimelech called also for Abraham, and\\nsaid to him: What hast thou done to us? what\\nhave we o\\x0bended thee in, that thou hast brought\\nupon me and upon my kingdom a great sin?\\nthou hast done to us what thou oughtest not\\nto do.\\n10And again he expostulated with him, and\\nsaid: What sawest thou, that thou hast done\\nthis?\\n11Abraham answered: I thought with myself,\\nsaying: Perhaps there is not the fear of God in\\nthis place: and they will kill me for the sake of\\nmy wife:\\n12Howbeit, otherwise also she is truly my\\nsister, the daughter of my father, and not the\\ndaughter of my mother, and I took her to wife.\\n13And after God brought me out of my fa-\\nther's house, I said to her: Thou shalt do me\\nthis kindness: In every place, to which we shall\\ncome, thou shalt say that I am thy brother.\\n14And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and\\nservants and handmaids, and gave to Abraham:\\nand restored to him Sara his wife,\\n15And said: The land is before you, dwell\\nwheresoever it shall please thee.\\n16And to Sara he said: Behold I have given\\nthy brother a thousand pieces of silver, this shall\\nserve thee for a covering of thy eyes to all that\\nare with thee, and whithersoever thou shalt go:and remember thou wast taken.\\n17And when Abraham prayed, God healed\\nAbimelech and his wife, and his handmaids, and\\nthey bore children:\\n18For the Lord had closed up every womb\\nof the house of Abimelech, on account of Sara,\\nAbraham's wife.\\nChapter 21\\nAnd the Lord visited Sara, as he had promised:\\nand ful\\x0clled what he had spoken.\\n2And she conceived and bore a son in her old\\nage, at the time that God had foretold her.\\n3And Abraham called the name of his son,\\nwhom Sara bore him, Isaac.\\n4And he circumcised him the eighth day, as\\nGod had commanded him,\\n5When he was a hundred years old: for at\\nthis age of his father, was Isaac born.\\n6And Sara said: God hath made a laughter\\nfor me: whosoever shall hear of it will laugh with\\nme.\\n7And again she said: Who would believe that\\nAbraham should hear that Sara gave suck to a\\nson, whom she bore to him in his old age?\\n8And the child grew, and was weaned: and\\nAbraham made a great feast on the day of his\\nweaning.\\n9And when Sara had seen the son of Agar,\\nthe Egyptian, playing with Isaac, her son, she\\nsaid to Abraham:\\n10Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for\\nthe son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with\\nmy son Isaac.\\n11Abraham took this grievously for his son.\\n12And God said to him: Let it not seem\\ngrievous to thee for the boy, and for thy bond-\\nwoman: in all that Sara hath said to thee, hear-\\nken to her voice: for in Isaac shall thy seed be\\ncalled.\\n13But I will make the son also of the bond-\\nwoman a great nation, because he is thy seed.\\n14So Abraham rose up in the morning, and\\ntaking bread and a bottle of water, put it upon\\nher shoulder, and delivered the boy, and sent her\\naway. And she departed, and wandered in the\\nwilderness of Bersabee.\\n15And when the water in the bottle was\\nspent, she cast the boy under one of the trees\\nthat were there.\\n16And she went her way, and sat overagainst\\nhim a great way o\\x0b, as far as a bow can carry, for\\nshe said: I will not see the boy die: and sitting\\noveragainst, she lifted up her voice and wept.\\n17And God heard the voice of the boy: and\\nan angel of God called to Agar from heaven, say-\\ning: What art thou doing, Agar? fear not; for\\nGod hath heard the voice of the boy, from the\\nplace wherein he is.\\n18Arise, take up the boy, and hold him by\\nthe hand, for I will make him a great nation.\\n19And God opened her eyes: and she saw a\\nwell of water, and went and \\x0clled the bottle, and\\ngave the boy to drink.\\n20And God was with him: and he grew, and\\ndwelt in the wilderness, and became a young\\nman, an archer.\\n21And he dwelt in the wilderness of Pharan,\\nand his mother took a wife for him out of the\\nland of Egypt.\\n22At the same time Abimelech, and Phicol\\nthe general of his army, said to Abraham: God\\nis with thee in all that thou dost.\\n23Swear therefore by God, that thou wilt not\\nhurt me, nor my posterity, nor my stock: but ac-\\ncording to the kindness that I have done to thee,\\nthou shalt do to me, and to the land wherein\\nthou hast lived a stranger.24And Abraham said: I will swear.\\n25And he reproved Abimelech for a well of\\nwater, which his servants had taken away by\\nforce.\\n26And Abimelech answered: I knew not who\\ndid this thing: and thou didst not tell me, and I\\nheard not of it till today.\\n27Then Abraham took sheep and oxen, and\\ngave them to Abimelech: and both of them made\\na league.\\n28And Abraham set apart seven ewelambs of\\nthe \\rock.\\n29And Abimelech said to him: What mean\\nthese seven ewelambs which thou hast set apart?\\n30But he said: Thou shalt take seven ewe-\\nlambs at my hand: that they may be a testimony\\nfor me, that I dug this well.\\n31Therefore that place was called Bersabee;\\nbecause there both of them did swear.\\n32And they made a league for the well of\\noath.\\n33And Abimelech and Phicol, the general\\nof his army, arose and returned to the land of\\nthe Palestines. But Abraham planted a grove in\\nBersabee, and there called upon the name of the\\nLord God eternal.\\n34And he was a sojourner in the land of the\\nPalestines many days.\\nChapter 22\\nAfter these things, God tempted Abraham, and\\nsaid to him: Abraham, Abraham. And he an-\\nswered: Here I am.\\n2He said to him: Take thy only begotten son\\nIsaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land\\nof vision; and there thou shalt o\\x0ber him for an\\nholocaust upon one of the mountains which I will\\nshew thee.\\n3So Abraham rising up in the night, saddled\\nhis ass, and took with him two young men, and\\nIsaac his son: and when he had cut wood for the\\nholocaust, he went his way to the place which\\nGod had commanded him.\\n4And on the third day, lifting up his eyes, he\\nsaw the place afar o\\x0b.\\n5And he said to his young men: Stay you here\\nwith the ass; I and the boy will go with speed\\nas far as yonder, and after we have worshipped,\\nwill return to you.\\n6And he took the wood for the holocaust, and\\nlaid it upon Isaac his son; and he himself carried\\nin his hands \\x0cre and a sword. And as they two\\nwent on together,\\n7Isaac said to his father: My father. And he\\nanswered: What wilt thou, son? Behold, saith\\nhe, \\x0cre and wood: where is the victim for the\\nholocaust?\\n8And Abraham said: God will provide him-\\nself a victim for an holocaust, my son. So they\\nwent on together.\\n9And they came to the place which God had\\nshewn him, where he built an altar, and laid the\\nwood in order upon it; and when he had bound\\nIsaac his son, he laid him on the altar upon the\\npile of wood.\\n10And he put forth his hand, and took the\\nsword, to sacri\\x0cce his son.\\n11And behold, an angel of the Lord from\\nheaven called to him, saying: Abraham, Abra-\\nham. And he answered: Here I am.\\n12And he said to him: Lay not thy hand upon\\nthe boy, neither do thou any thing to him: now I\\nknow that thou fearest God, and hast not spared\\nthy only begotten son for my sake.\\n13Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw behind\\nhis back a ram, amongst the briers, sticking fast\\nby the horns, which he took and o\\x0bered for a\\nholocaust instead of his son.14And he called the name of that place, The\\nLord seeth. Whereupon, even to this day, it is\\nsaid: In the mountain the Lord will see.\\n15And the angel of the Lord called to Abra-\\nham a second time from heaven, saying:\\n16By my own self have I sworn, saith the\\nLord: because thou hast done this thing, and\\nhast not spared thy only begotten son for my\\nsake:\\n17I will bless thee, and I will multiply thy\\nseed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that\\nis by the sea shore; thy seed shall possess the\\ngates of their enemies.\\n18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the\\nearth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed my\\nvoice.\\n19Abraham returned to his young men, and\\nthey went to Bersabee together, and he dwelt\\nthere.\\n20After these things, it was told Abraham,\\nthat Melcha also had borne children to Nachor\\nhis brother.\\n21Hus, the \\x0crstborn, and Buz, his brother,\\nand Camuel the father of the Syrians,\\n22And Cased, and Azau, and Pheldas, and\\nJedlaph,\\n23And Bathuel, of whom was born Rebecca:\\nthese eight did Melcha bear to Nachor, Abra-\\nham's brother.\\n24And his concubine, named Roma, bore\\nTabee, and Gaham, and Tahas, and Maacha.\\nChapter 23\\nAnd Sara lived a hundred and twenty-seven\\nyears.\\n2And she died in the city of Arbee which is\\nHebron, in the land of Chanaan: and Abraham\\ncame to mourn and weep for her.\\n3And after he rose up from the funeral obse-\\nquies, he spoke to the children of Heth, saying:\\n4I am a stranger and sojourner among you:\\ngive me the right of a burying place with you,\\nthat I may bury my dead.\\n5The children of Heth answered, saying:\\n6My lord, hear us, thou art a prince of God\\namong us: bury thy dead in our principal sepul-\\nchres: and no man shall have power to hinder\\nthee from burying thy dead in his sepulchre.\\n7Abraham rose up, and bowed down to the\\npeople of the land, to wit, the children of Heth:\\n8And said to them: If it please your soul that\\nI should bury my dead, hear me, and intercede\\nfor me to Ephron the son of Seor.\\n9That he may give me the double cave, which\\nhe hath in the end of his \\x0celd: For as much\\nmoney as it is worth he shall give it me before\\nyou, for a possession of a burying place.\\n10Now Ephron dwelt in the midst of the\\nchildren of Heth. And Ephron made answer to\\nAbraham in the hearing of all that went in at\\nthe gate of the city, saying:\\n11Let it not be so, my lord, but do thou\\nrather hearken to what I say: The \\x0celd I de-\\nliver to thee, and the cave that is therein; in the\\npresence of the children of my people, bury thy\\ndead.\\n12Abraham bowed down before the people of\\nthe land.\\n13And he spoke to Ephron, in the presence\\nof the people: I beseech thee to hear me: I will\\ngive money for the \\x0celd; take it, and so will I\\nbury my dead in it.\\n14And Ephron answered:\\n15My lord, hear me. The ground which thou\\ndesirest, is worth four hundred sicles of silver:\\nthis is the price between me and thee: but what\\nis this? bury thy dead.16And when Abraham had heard this, he\\nweighed out the money that Ephron had asked,\\nin the hearing of the children of Heth, four hun-\\ndred sicles of silver, of common current money.\\n17And the \\x0celd that before was Ephron's,\\nwherein was the double cave, looking towards\\nMambre, both it and the cave, and all the trees\\nthereof, in all its limits round about,\\n18Was made sure to Abraham for a posses-\\nsion, in the sight of the children of Heth, and of\\nall that went in at the gate of his city.\\n19And so Abraham buried Sara, his wife, in\\nthe double cave of the \\x0celd, that looked towards\\nMambre, this is Hebron in the land of Chanaan.\\n20And the \\x0celd was made sure to Abraham,\\nand the cave that was in it, for a possession to\\nbury in, by the children of Heth.\\nChapter 24\\nNow Abraham was old, and advanced in age; and\\nthe Lord had blessed him in all things.\\n2And he said to the elder servant of his house,\\nwho was ruler over all he had: Put thy hand\\nunder my thigh,\\n3That I may make thee swear by the Lord, the\\nGod of heaven and earth, that thou take not a\\nwife for my son, of the daughters of the Chanaan-\\nites, among whom I dwell:\\n4But that thou go to my own country and\\nkindred, and take a wife from thence for my son\\nIsaac.\\n5The servant answered: If the woman will not\\ncome with me into this land, must I bring thy son\\nback again to the place from whence thou camest\\nout?\\n6And Abraham said: Beware thou never\\nbring my son back again thither.\\n7The Lord God of heaven, who took me out\\nof my father's house, and out of my native coun-\\ntry, who spoke to me, and swore to me, saying:\\nTo thy seed will I give this land: he will send\\nhis angel before thee, and thou shalt take from\\nthence a wife for my son.\\n8But if the woman will not follow thee, thou\\nshalt not be bound by the oath: only bring not\\nmy son back thither again.\\n9The servant, therefore, put his hand under\\nthe thigh of Abraham, his lord, and swore to him\\nupon his word.\\n10And he took ten camels of his master's\\nherd, and departed, carrying something of all his\\ngoods with him, and he set forward and went on\\nto Mesopotamia, to the city of Nachor.\\n11And when he had made the camels lie down\\nwithout the town, near a well of water, in the\\nevening, at the time when women are wont to\\ncome out to draw water, he said:\\n12O Lord, the God of my master, Abraham,\\nmeet me today, I beseech thee, and shew kind-\\nness to my master, Abraham.\\n13Behold, I stand nigh the spring of water,\\nand the daughters of the inhabitants of this city\\nwill come out to draw water:\\n14Now, therefore, the maid to whom I shall\\nsay: Let down thy pitcher that I may drink:\\nand she shall answer, Drink, and I will give thy\\ncamels drink also: let it be the same whom thou\\nhast provided for thy servant Isaac: and by this,\\nI shall understand that thou hast shewn kindness\\nto my master.\\n15He had not yet ended these words within\\nhimself, and behold Rebecca came out, the\\ndaughter of Bathuel, son of Melcha, wife to Na-\\nchor the brother of Abraham, having a pitcher\\non her shoulder:\\n16An exceeding comely maid, and a most\\nbeautiful virgin, and not known to man: and she\\nwent down to the spring, and \\x0clled her pitcher,and was coming back.\\n17And the servant ran to meet her, and said:\\nGive me a little water to drink of thy pitcher.\\n18And she answered: Drink, my lord. And\\nquickly she let down the pitcher upon her arm,\\nand gave him drink.\\n19And when he had drunk, she said: I will\\ndraw water for thy camels also, till they all drink.\\n20And pouring out the pitcher into the\\ntroughs, she ran back to the well to draw water;\\nand having drawn, she gave to all the camels.\\n21But he musing, beheld her with silence,\\ndesirous to know whether the Lord had made\\nhis journey prosperous or not.\\n22And after that the camels had drunk, the\\nman took out golden earrings, weighing two\\nsicles; and as many bracelets, of ten sicles weight.\\n23And he said to her: Whose daughter art\\nthou? tell me: is there any place in thy father's\\nhouse to lodge?\\n24And she answered: I am the daughter of\\nBathuel, the son of Melcha, whom she bore to\\nNachor.\\n25And she said, moreover, to him: We have\\ngood store of both straw and hay, and a large\\nplace to lodge in.\\n26The man bowed himself down, and adored\\nthe Lord,\\n27Saying: Blessed be the Lord God of my\\nmaster Abraham, who hath not taken away his\\nmercy and truth from my master, and hath\\nbrought me the straight way into the house of\\nmy master's brother.\\n28Then the maid ran, and told in her\\nmother's house all that she had heard.\\n29And Rebecca had a brother, named Laban,\\nwho went out in haste to the man, to the well.\\n30And when he had seen the earrings and\\nbracelets in his sister's hands, and had heard all\\nthat she related, saying, Thus and thus the man\\nspoke to me: he came to the man who stood by\\nthe camels, and near to the spring of water,\\n31And said to him: Come in, thou blessed\\nof the Lord; why standest thou without? I have\\nprepared the house, and a place for the camels.\\n32And he brought him into his lodging; and\\nhe unharnessed the camels, and gave straw and\\nhay, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of\\nthe men that were come with him.\\n33And bread was set before him. But he said:\\nI will not eat, till I tell my message. He answered\\nhim: Speak.\\n34And he said: I am the servant of Abraham:\\n35And the Lord hath blessed my master won-\\nderfully, and he is become great: and he hath\\ngiven him sheep and oxen, silver and gold, men\\nservants and women servants, camels and asses.\\n36And Sara, my master's wife, hath borne my\\nmaster a son in her old age, and he hath given\\nhim all that he had.\\n37And my master made me swear, saying:\\nThou shalt not take a wife for my son of the\\nChanaanites, in whose land I dwell:\\n38But thou shalt go to my father's house, and\\nshalt take a wife of my own kindred for my son:\\n39But I answered my master: What if the\\nwoman will not come with me?\\n40The Lord, said he, in whose sight I walk,\\nwill send his angel with thee, and will direct thy\\nway: and thou shalt take a wife for my son of\\nmy own kindred, and of my father's house.\\n41But thou shalt be clear from my curse,\\nwhen thou shalt come to my kindred, if they will\\nnot give thee one.\\n42And I came today to the well of water,\\nand said: O Lord God of my master, Abraham,\\nif thou hast prospered my way, wherein I now\\nwalk,\\n43Behold, I stand by the well of water, and\\nthe virgin, that shall come out to draw water,who shall hear me say: Give me a little water to\\ndrink of thy pitcher:\\n44And shall say to me: Both drink thou, and\\nI will also draw for thy camels: let the same be\\nthe woman, whom the Lord hath prepared for\\nmy master's son.\\n45And whilst I pondered these things secretly\\nwith myself, Rebecca appeared, coming with a\\npitcher, which she carried on her shoulder: and\\nshe went down to the well and drew water. And\\nI said to her: Give me a little to drink.\\n46And she speedily let down the pitcher from\\nher shoulder, and said to me: Both drink thou,\\nand to thy camels I will give drink. I drank, and\\nshe watered the camels.\\n47And I asked her, and said: Whose daughter\\nart thou? And she answered: I am the daugh-\\nter of Bathuel, the son of Nachor, whom Melcha\\nbore to him. So I put earrings on her to adorn\\nher face, and I put bracelets on her hands.\\n48And falling down, I adored the Lord, bless-\\ning the Lord God of my master, Abraham, who\\nhath brought me the straight way to take the\\ndaughter of my master's brother for his son.\\n49Wherefore, if you do according to mercy\\nand truth with my master, tell me: but if it\\nplease you otherwise, tell me that also, that I\\nmay go to the right hand, or to the left.\\n50And Laban and Bathuel answered: The\\nword hath proceeded from the Lord: we cannot\\nspeak any other thing to thee but his pleasure.\\n51Behold, Rebecca is before thee, take her\\nand go thy way, and let her be the wife of thy\\nmaster's son, as the Lord hath spoken.\\n52Which when Abraham's servant heard,\\nfalling down to the ground, he adored the Lord.\\n53And bringing forth vessels of silver and\\ngold, and garments, he gave them to Rebecca,\\nfor a present. He o\\x0bered gifts also to her broth-\\ners, and to her mother.\\n54And a banquet was made, and they ate\\nand drank together, and lodged there. And in\\nthe morning, the servant arose, and said: Let\\nme depart, that I may go to my master.\\n55And her brother and mother answered: Let\\nthe maid stay, at least, ten days with us, and\\nafterwards she shall depart.\\n56Stay me not, said he, because the Lord\\nhath prospered my way: send me away, that I\\nmay go to my master.\\n57And they said: Let us call the maid, and\\nask her will.\\n58And they called her, and when she was\\ncome, they asked: Wilt thou go with this man?\\nShe said: I will go.\\n59So they sent her away, and her nurse, and\\nAbraham's servant, and his company.\\n60Wishing prosperity to their sister, and say-\\ning: Thou art our sister, mayst thou increase to\\nthousands of thousands; and may thy seed pos-\\nsess the gates of their enemies.\\n61So Rebecca and her maids, being set upon\\ncamels, followed the man: who with speed re-\\nturned to his master.\\n62At the same time, Isaac was walking along\\nthe way to the well which is called Of the living\\nand the seeing: for he dwelt in the south country:\\n63And he was gone forth to meditate in the\\n\\x0celd, the day being now well spent: and when\\nhe had lifted up his eyes, he saw camels coming\\nafar o\\x0b.\\n64Rebecca also, when she saw Isaac, lighted\\no\\x0b the camel,\\n65And said to the servant: Who is that man\\nwho cometh towards us along the \\x0celd? And he\\nsaid to her: That man is my master. But she\\nquickly took her cloak, and covered herself.\\n66And the servant told Isaac all that he had\\ndone.67Who brought her into the tent of Sara his\\nmother, and took her to wife: and he loved her\\nso much, that it moderated the sorrow which was\\noccasioned by his mother's death.\\nChapter 25\\nAnd Abraham married another wife named Ce-\\ntura:\\n2Who bore him Zamram, and Jecsan, and\\nMadan, and Madian, and Jesboc, and Sue.\\n3Jecsan also begot Saba, and Dadan. The\\nchildren of Dadan were Assurim, and Latusim,\\nand Loomim.\\n4But of Madian was born Epha, and Opher,\\nand Henoch, and Abida, and Eldaa: all these\\nwere the children of Cetura.\\n5And Abraham gave all his possessions to\\nIsaac:\\n6And to the children of the concubines he\\ngave gifts, and separated them from Isaac his\\nson, while he yet lived, to the east country.\\n7And the days of Abraham's life were a hun-\\ndred and seventy-\\x0cve years.\\n8And decaying he died in a good old age, and\\nhaving lived a long time, and being full of days:\\nand was gathered to his people.\\n9And Isaac and Ismael his sons buried him\\nin the double cave, which was situated in the\\n\\x0celd of Ephron the son of Seor the Hethite, over\\nagainst Mambre,\\n10Which he had bought of the children of\\nHeth: there was he buried, and Sara his wife.\\n11And after his death, God blessed Isaac his\\nson, who dwelt by the well named Of the living\\nand seeing.\\n12These are the generations of Ismael the son\\nof Abraham, whom Agar the Egyptian, Sara's\\nservant, bore unto him:\\n13And these are the names of his children\\naccording to their calling and generations. The\\n\\x0crstborn of Ismael was Nabajoth, then Cedar,\\nand Adbeel, and Mabsam,\\n14And Masma, and Duma, and Massa,\\n15Hadar, and Thema, and Jethur, and\\nNaphis, and Cedma.\\n16These are the sons of Ismael: and these are\\ntheir names by their castles and towns, twelve\\nprinces of their tribes.\\n17And the years of Ismael's life were a hun-\\ndred and thirty-seven, and decaying he died, and\\nwas gathered unto his people.\\n18And he dwelt from Hevila as far as Sur,\\nwhich looketh towards Egypt, to them that go\\ntowards the Assyrians. He died in the presence\\nof all his brethren.\\n19These also are the generations of Isaac the\\nson of Abraham: Abraham begot Isaac:\\n20Who when he was forty years old, took to\\nwife Rebecca the daughter of Bathuel the Syrian\\nof Mesopotamia, sister to Laban.\\n21And Isaac besought the Lord for his wife,\\nbecause she was barren: and he heard him, and\\nmade Rebecca to conceive.\\n22But the children struggled in her womb,\\nand she said: If it were to be so with me, what\\nneed was there to conceive? And she went to\\nconsult the Lord.\\n23And he answering, said: Two nations are\\nin thy womb, and two peoples shall be divided\\nout of thy womb, and one people shall overcome\\nthe other, and the elder shall serve the younger.\\n24And when her time was come to be deliv-\\nered, behold twins were found in her womb.\\n25He that came forth \\x0crst was red, and hairy\\nlike a skin: and his name was called Esau. Imme-\\ndiately the other coming forth, held his brother's\\nfoot in his hand: and therefore he was called Ja-\\ncob.26Isaac was threescore years old when the\\nchildren were born unto him.\\n27And when they were grown up, Esau be-\\ncame a skilful hunter, and a husbandman: but\\nJacob, a plain man, dwelt in tents.\\n28Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his\\nhunting: and Rebecca loved Jacob.\\n29And Jacob boiled pottage: to whom Esau,\\ncoming faint out of the \\x0celd,\\n30Said: Give me of this red pottage, for I am\\nexceeding faint. For which reason his name was\\ncalled Edom.\\n31And Jacob said to him: Sell me thy \\x0crst\\nbirthright.\\n32He answered: Lo I die, what will the \\x0crst\\nbirthright avail me?\\n33Jacob said: Swear therefore to me. Esau\\nswore to him, and sold his \\x0crst birthright.\\n34And so taking bread and the pottage of\\nlentils, he ate, and drank, and went on his way;\\nmaking little account of having sold his \\x0crst\\nbirthright.\\nChapter 26\\nAnd when a famine came in the land, after that\\nbarrenness which had happened in the days of\\nAbraham, Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the\\nPalestines, to Gerara.\\n2And the Lord appeared to him, and said:\\nGo not down into Egypt, but stay in the land\\nthat I shall tell thee.\\n3And sojourn in it, and I will be with thee,\\nand will bless thee: for to thee and to thy seed\\nI will give all these countries, to ful\\x0cl the oath\\nwhich I swore to Abraham thy father.\\n4And I will multiply thy seed like the stars of\\nheaven: and I will give to thy posterity all these\\ncountries: and in thy seed shall all the nations\\nof the earth be blessed.\\n5Because Abraham obeyed my voice, and\\nkept my precepts and commandments, and ob-\\nserved my ceremonies and laws.\\n6So Isaac abode in Gerara.\\n7And when he was asked by the men of that\\nplace, concerning his wife, he answered: She is\\nmy sister: for he was afraid to confess that she\\nwas his wife, thinking lest perhaps they would\\nkill him because of her beauty.\\n8And when very many days were passed,\\nand he abode there, Abimelech, king of the\\nPalestines, looking out through a window, saw\\nhim playing with Rebecca, his wife.\\n9And calling for him, he said: It is evident\\nshe is thy wife: why didst thou feign her to be\\nthy sister? He answered: I feared lest I should\\ndie for her sake.\\n10And Abimelech said: Why hast thou de-\\nceived us? Some man of the people might have\\nlain with thy wife, and thou hadst brought upon\\nus a great sin. And he commanded all the peo-\\nple, saying:\\n11He that shall touch this man's wife, shall\\nsurely be put to death.\\n12And Isaac sowed in that land, and he found\\nthat same year a hundredfold: and the Lord\\nblessed him.\\n13And the man was enriched, and he went\\non prospering and increasing, till he became ex-\\nceeding great.\\n14And he had possessions of sheep and of\\nherds, and a very great family. Wherefore the\\nPalestines envying him,\\n15Stopped up at that time all the wells, that\\nthe servants of his father, Abraham, had digged,\\n\\x0clling them up with earth:\\n16Insomuch that Abimelech himself said to\\nIsaac: Depart from us, for thou art become much\\nmightier than we.17So he departed, and came to the torrent of\\nGerara, to dwell there:\\n18And he digged again other wells, which the\\nservants of his father, Abraham, had digged, and\\nwhich, after his death, the Philistines had of old\\nstopped up: and he called them by the same\\nnames, by which his father before had called\\nthem.\\n19And they digged in the torrent, and found\\nliving water:\\n20But there also the herdsmen of Gerara\\nstrove against the herdsmen of Isaac, saying: It is\\nour water. Wherefore he called the name of the\\nwell, on occasion of that which had happened,\\nCalumny.\\n21And they digged also another; and for that\\nthey quarrelled likewise, and he called the name\\nof it, Enmity.\\n22Going forward from thence, he digged an-\\nother well, for which they contended not; there-\\nfore he called the name thereof, Latitude, saying:\\nNow hath the Lord given us room, and made us\\nto increase upon the earth.\\n23And he went up from that place to\\nBersabee,\\n24Where the Lord appeared to him that same\\nnight, saying: I am the God of Abraham thy\\nfather, do not fear, for I am with thee: I will\\nbless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant\\nAbraham's sake.\\n25And he built there an altar: and called\\nupon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent;\\nand commanded his servants to dig a well.\\n26To which place when Abimelech, and\\nOchozath his friend, and Phicol chief captain of\\nhis soldiers, came from Gerara,\\n27Isaac said to them: Why are ye come to\\nme, a man whom you hate, and have thrust out\\nfrom you?\\n28And they answered: We saw that the Lord\\nis with thee, and therefore we said: Let there be\\nan oath between us, and let us make a covenant,\\n29That thou do us no harm, as we on our part\\nhave touched nothing of thine, nor have done any\\nthing to hurt thee; but with peace have sent thee\\naway, increased with the blessing of the Lord.\\n30And he made them a feast, and after they\\nhad eaten and drunk:\\n31Arising in the morning, they swore one to\\nanother: and Isaac sent them away peaceably to\\ntheir own home.\\n32And behold, the same day the servants of\\nIsaac came, telling him of a well which they had\\ndigged, and saying: We have found water.\\n33Whereupon he called it Abundance: and\\nthe name of the city was called Bersabee, even\\nto this day.\\n34And Esau being forty years old, married\\nwives, Judith, the daughter of Beeri, the Hethite,\\nand Basemath, the daughter of Elon, of the same\\nplace.\\n35And they both o\\x0bended the mind of Isaac\\nand Rebecca.\\nChapter 27\\nNow Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, and\\nhe could not see: and he called Esau, his elder\\nson, and said to him: My son? And he answered:\\nHere I am.\\n2And his father said to him, Thou seest that\\nI am old, and know not the day of my death.\\n3Take thy arms, thy quiver, and bow, and go\\nabroad; and when thou hast taken something by\\nhunting,\\n4Make me a savoury meat thereof, as thou\\nknowest I like, and bring it that I may eat: and\\nmy soul may bless thee, before I die.\\n5And when Rebecca had heard this, and hewas gone into the \\x0celd to ful\\x0cl his father's com-\\nmandment,\\n6She said to her son Jacob: I heard thy father\\ntalking with Esau, thy brother, and saying to\\nhim:\\n7Bring me of thy hunting, and make me meats\\nthat I may eat, and bless thee in the sight of the\\nLord, before I die.\\n8Now therefore, my son, follow my counsel:\\n9And go thy way to the \\rock, bring me two\\nkids of the best, that I may make of them meat\\nfor thy father, such as he gladly eateth.\\n10Which when thou hast brought in, and he\\nhath eaten, he may bless thee before he die.\\n11And he answered her: Thou knowest that\\nEsau, my brother, is a hairy man, and I am\\nsmooth:\\n12If my father should feel me, and perceive\\nit, I fear lest he will think I would have mocked\\nhim, and I shall bring upon me a curse instead\\nof a blessing.\\n13And his mother said to him: Upon me be\\nthis curse, my son: only hear thou my voice, and\\ngo, fetch me the things which I have said.\\n14He went, and brought, and gave them to\\nhis mother. She dressed meats, such as she knew\\nhis father liked.\\n15And she put on him very good garments of\\nEsau, which she had at home with her:\\n16And the little skins of the kids she put\\nabout his hands, and covered the bare of his\\nneck.\\n17And she gave him the savoury meat, and\\ndelivered him bread that she had baked.\\n18Which when he had carried in, he said: My\\nfather? But he answered: I hear. Who art thou,\\nmy son?\\n19And Jacob said: I am Esau, thy \\x0crstborn:\\nI have done as thou didst command me: arise, sit\\nand eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless\\nme.\\n20And Isaac said to his son: How couldst\\nthou \\x0cnd it so quickly, my son? He answered:\\nIt was the will of God, that what I sought came\\nquickly in my way:\\n21And Isaac said: Come hither, that I may\\nfeel thee, my son, and may prove whether thou\\nbe my son Esau, or no.\\n22He came near to his father, and when he\\nhad felt him, Isaac said: The voice indeed is the\\nvoice of Jacob; but the hands, are the hands of\\nEsau.\\n23And he knew him not, because his hairy\\nhands made him like to the elder. Then blessing\\nhim,\\n24He said: Art thou my son Esau? He an-\\nswered: I am.\\n25Then he said: Bring me the meats of thy\\nhunting, my son, that my soul may bless thee.\\nAnd when they were brought, and he had eaten,\\nhe o\\x0bered him wine also, which after he had\\ndrunk,\\n26He said to him: Come near me, and give\\nme a kiss, my son.\\n27He came near, and kissed him. And im-\\nmediately as he smelled the fragrant smell of\\nhis garments, blessing him, he said: Behold, the\\nsmell of my son is as the smell of a plentiful \\x0celd,\\nwhich the Lord hath blessed.\\n28God give thee of the dew of heaven, and of\\nthe fatness of the earth, abundance of corn and\\nwine.\\n29And let peoples serve thee, and tribes wor-\\nship thee: be thou lord of thy brethren, and\\nlet thy mother's children bow down before thee.\\nCursed be he that curseth thee: and let him that\\nblesseth thee be \\x0clled with blessings.\\n30Isaac had scarce ended his words, when,\\nJacob being now gone out abroad, Esau came,31And brought in to his father meats, made\\nof what he had taken in hunting, saying: Arise,\\nmy father, and eat of thy son's venison; that thy\\nsoul may bless me.\\n32And Isaac said to him: Why! who art\\nthou? He answered: I am thy \\x0crstborn son,\\nEsau.\\n33Isaac was struck with fear, and astonished\\nexceedingly; and wondering beyond what can be\\nbelieved, said: Who is he then that even now\\nbrought me venison that he had taken, and I ate\\nof all before thou camest? and I have blessed\\nhim, and he shall be blessed.\\n34Esau having heard his father's words,\\nroared out with a great cry; and, being in a con-\\nsternation, said: Bless me also, my father.\\n35And he said: Thy brother came deceitfully\\nand got thy blessing.\\n36But he said again: Rightly is his name\\ncalled Jacob; for he hath supplanted me lo this\\nsecond time: My birthright he took away before,\\nand now this second time he hath stolen away\\nmy blessing. And again he said to his father:\\nHast thou not reserved me also a blessing?\\n37Isaac answered: I have appointed him thy\\nlord, and have made all his brethren his servants:\\nI have established him with corn and wine, and\\nafter this, what shall I do more for thee, my son?\\n38And Esau said to him: Hast thou only one\\nblessing, father? I beseech thee bless me also.\\nAnd when he wept with a loud cry,\\n39Isaac being moved, said to him: In the\\nfat of the earth, and in the dew of heaven from\\nabove,\\n40Shall thy blessing be. Thou shalt live by\\nthe sword, and shalt serve thy brother: and the\\ntime shall come, when thou shalt shake o\\x0b and\\nloose his yoke from thy neck.\\n41Esau therefore always hated Jacob, for the\\nblessing wherewith his father had blessed him;\\nand he said in his heart: The days will come of\\nthe mourning for my father, and I will kill my\\nbrother Jacob.\\n42These things were told to Rebecca: and\\nshe sent and called Jacob, her son, and said to\\nhim: Behold Esau, thy brother, threateneth to\\nkill thee.\\n43Now therefore, my son, hear my voice, arise\\nand \\ree to Laban, my brother, to Haran:\\n44And thou shalt dwell with him a few days,\\ntill the wrath of thy brother be assuaged,\\n45And his indignation cease, and he forget\\nthe things thou hast done to him: afterwards\\nI will send, and bring thee from thence hither.\\nWhy shall I be deprived of both my sons in one\\nday?\\n46And Rebecca said to Isaac: I am weary\\nof my life, because of the daughters of Heth: if\\nJacob take a wife of the stock of this land, I\\nchoose not to live.\\nChapter 28\\nAnd Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and\\ncharged him, saying: Take not a wife of the stock\\nof Chanaan:\\n2But go, and take a journey to Mesopotamia\\nof Syria, to the house of Bathuel, thy mother's\\nfather, and take thee a wife thence of the daugh-\\nters of Laban, thy uncle.\\n3And God almighty bless thee, and make thee\\nto increase and multiply thee: that thou mayst\\nbe a multitude of people.\\n4And give the blessings of Araham to thee,\\nand to thy seed after thee: that thou mayst\\npossess the land of thy sojournment, which he\\npromised to thy grandfather.\\n5And when Isaac had sent him away, he took\\nhis journey and went to Mesopotamia of Syria,to Laban, the son of Bathuel, the Syrian, brother\\nto Rebecca, his mother.\\n6And Esau seeing that his father had blessed\\nJacob, and had sent him into Mesopotamia of\\nSyria, to marry a wife thence; and that after the\\nblessing he had charged him, saying: Thou shalt\\nnot take a wife of the daughters of Chanaan:\\n7And that Jacob obeying his parents, was\\ngone into Syria:\\n8Experiencing also, that his father was not\\nwell pleased with the daughters of Chanaan:\\n9He went to Ismael, and took to wife, besides\\nthem he had before, Maheleth, the daughter of\\nIsmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nabajoth.\\n10But Jacob being departed from Bersabee,\\nwent on to Haran.\\n11And when he was come to a certain place,\\nand would rest in it after sunset, he took of\\nthe stones that lay there, and putting under his\\nhead, slept in the same place.\\n12And he saw in his sleep a ladder stand-\\ning upon the earth, and the top thereof touching\\nheaven: the angels also of God ascending and\\ndescending by it.\\n13And the Lord leaning upon the ladder say-\\ning to him: I am the Lord God of Abraham thy\\nfather, and the God of Isaac: The land, wherein\\nthou sleepest, I will give to thee and to thy seed.\\n14And thy seed shall be as the dust of the\\nearth: thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and\\nto the east, and to the north, and to the south:\\nand IN THEE and thy seed, all the tribes of the\\nearth SHALL BE BLESSED.\\n15And I will be thy keeper whithersoever\\nthou goest, and will bring thee back into this\\nland: neither will I leave thee, till I shall have\\naccomplished all that I have said.\\n16And when Jacob awaked out of sleep, he\\nsaid: Indeed the Lord is in this place, and I knew\\nit not.\\n17And trembling, he said: How terrible is this\\nplace? this is no other but the house of God, and\\nthe gate of heaven.\\n18And Jacob arising in the morning, took the\\nstone which he had laid under his head, and set\\nit up for a title, pouring oil upon the top of it.\\n19And he called the name of the city Bethel,\\nwhich before was called Luza.\\n20And he made a vow, saying: If God shall\\nbe with me, and shall keep me in the way, by\\nwhich I walk, and shall give me bread to eat,\\nand raiment to put on,\\n21And I shall return prosperously to my fa-\\nther's house: the Lord shall be my God:\\n22And this stone, which I have set up for a\\ntitle, shall be called the house of God: and of\\nall things that thou shalt give to me, I will o\\x0ber\\ntithes to thee.\\nChapter 29\\nThen Jacob went on in his journey, and came\\ninto the east country.\\n2And he saw a well in the \\x0celd, and three\\n\\rocks of sheep lying by it: for the beasts were\\nwatered out of it, and the mouth thereof was\\nclosed with a great stone.\\n3And the custom was, when all the sheep\\nwere gathered together, to roll away the stone,\\nand after the sheep were watered, to put it on\\nthe mouth of the well again.\\n4And he said to the shepherds: Brethren,\\nwhence are you? They answered: Of Haran.\\n5And he asked them, saying: Know you La-\\nban, the son of Nachor? They said: We know\\nhim.\\n6He said: Is he in health? He is in health, say\\nthey: and behold, Rachel, his daughter, cometh\\nwith his \\rock.7And Jacob said: There is yet much day re-\\nmaining, neither is it time to bring the \\rocks into\\nthe folds again: \\x0crst give the sheep drink, and\\nso lead them back to feed.\\n8They answered: We cannot, till all the cattle\\nbe gathered together, and we remove the stone\\nfrom the well's mouth, that we may water the\\n\\rocks.\\n9They were yet speaking, and behold Rachel\\ncame with her father's sheep; for she fed the\\n\\rock.\\n10And when Jacob saw her, and knew her\\nto be his cousin german, and that they were the\\nsheep of Laban, his uncle: he removed the stone\\nwherewith the well was closed.\\n11And having watered the \\rock, he kissed\\nher: and lifting up his voice wept.\\n12And he told her that he was her father's\\nbrother, and the son of Rebecca: but she went\\nin haste and told her father.\\n13Who, when he heard that Jacob his sister's\\nson was come, ran forth to meet him: and em-\\nbracing him, and heartily kissing him, brought\\nhim into his house. And when he had heard the\\ncauses of his journey,\\n14He answered: Thou art my bone and my\\n\\resh. And after the days of one month were\\nexpired,\\n15He said to him: Because thou art my\\nbrother, shalt thou serve me without wages? Tell\\nme what wages thou wilt have.\\n16Now he had two daughters, the name of\\nthe elder was Lia; and the younger was called\\nRachel.\\n17But Lia was blear eyed: Rachel was well\\nfavoured, and of a beautiful countenance.\\n18And Jacob being in love with her, said:\\nI will serve thee seven years for Rachel, thy\\nyounger daughter.\\n19Laban answered: It is better that I give her\\nto thee than to another man; stay with me.\\n20So Jacob served seven years for Rachel:\\nand they seemed but a few days, because of the\\ngreatness of his love.\\n21And he said to Laban: Give me my wife;\\nfor now the time is ful\\x0clled, that I may go in\\nunto her.\\n22And he, having invited a great number of\\nhis friends to the feast, made the marriage.\\n23And at night he brought in Lia, his daugh-\\nter, to him,\\n24Giving his daughter a handmaid, named\\nZelpha. Now when Jacob had gone in to her\\naccording to custom, when morning was come\\nhe saw it was Lia.\\n25And he said to his father in law: What is\\nit that thou didst mean to do? did not I serve\\nthee for Rachel? why hast thou deceived me?\\n26Laban answered: It is not the custom in\\nthis place, to give the younger in marriage \\x0crst.\\n27Make up the week of days of this match:\\nand I will give thee her also, for the service that\\nthou shalt render me other seven years.\\n28He yielded to his pleasure: and after the\\nweek was past, he married Rachel:\\n29To whom her father gave Bala, for her ser-\\nvant.\\n30And having at length obtained the mar-\\nriage he wished for, he preferred the love of the\\nlatter before the former, and served with him\\nother seven years.\\n31And the Lord seeing that he despised Lia,\\nopened her womb, but her sister remained bar-\\nren.\\n32And she conceived and bore a son, and\\ncalled his name Ruben, saying: The Lord saw\\nmy a\\x0fiction: now my husband will love me.\\n33And again she conceived and bore a son,\\nand said: Because the Lord heard that I wasdespised, he hath given this also to me: and she\\ncalled his name Simeon.\\n34And she conceived the third time, and bore\\nanother son, and said: Now also my husband will\\nbe joined to me, because I have borne him three\\nsons: and therefore she called his name Levi.\\n35The fourth time she conceived and bore a\\nson, and said: Now will I praise the Lord: and for\\nthis she called him Juda. And she left bearing.\\nChapter 30\\nAnd Rachel seeing herself without children, en-\\nvied her sister, and said to her husband: Give\\nme children, otherwise I shall die.\\n2And Jacob being angry with her, answered:\\nAm I as God, who hath deprived thee of the fruit\\nof thy womb?\\n3But she said: I have here my servant Bala:\\ngo in unto her, that she may bear upon my knees,\\nand I may have children by her.\\n4And she gave him Bala in marriage: who,\\n5When her husband had gone in unto her,\\nconceived and bore a son.\\n6And Rachel said: The Lord hath judged for\\nme, and hath heard my voice, giving me a son;\\nand therefore she called his name Dan.\\n7And again Bala conceived, and bore another,\\n8For whom Rachel said: God hath compared\\nme with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she\\ncalled him Nephthali.\\n9Lia perceiving that she had left of bearing,\\ngave Zelpha, her handmaid, to her husband.\\n10And when she had conceived, and brought\\nforth a son,\\n11She said: Happily. And therefore called his\\nname Gad.\\n12Zelpha also bore another.\\n13And Lia said: This is for my happiness: for\\nwomen will call me blessed. Therefore she called\\nhim Aser.\\n14And Ruben going out in the time of the\\nwheat harvest into the \\x0celd, found mandrakes:\\nwhich he brought to his mother Lia. And Rachel\\nsaid: Give me part of thy son's mandrakes.\\n15She answered: Dost thou think it a small\\nmatter, that thou hast taken my husband from\\nme, unless thou take also my son's mandrakes?\\nRachel said: He shall sleep with thee this night,\\nfor thy son's mandrakes.\\n16And when Jacob returned at even from the\\n\\x0celd, Lia went out to meet him, and said: Thou\\nshalt come in unto me, because I have hired thee\\nfor my son's mandrakes. And he slept with her\\nthat night.\\n17And God heard her prayers; and she con-\\nceived: and bore a \\x0cfth son:\\n18And said: God hath given me a reward,\\nbecause I gave my handmaid to my husband.\\nAnd she called his name Issachar.\\n19And Lia conceived again, and bore the\\nsixth son,\\n20And said: God hath endowed me with a\\ngood dowry; this turn also my husband will be\\nwith me, because I have borne him six sons: and\\ntherefore she called his name Zabulon.\\n21After whom she bore a daughter, named\\nDina.\\n22The Lord also remembering Rachel, heard\\nher, and opened her womb.\\n23And she conceived, and bore a son, saying:\\nGod hath taken away my reproach.\\n24And she called his name Joseph: saying:\\nThe Lord give me also another son.\\n25And when Joseph was born, Jacob said to\\nhis father in law: Send me away, that I may\\nreturn into my country, and to my land.26Give me my wives, and my children, for\\nwhom I have served thee, that I may depart:\\nthou knowest the service that I have rendered\\nthee.\\n27Laban said to him: Let me \\x0cnd favour in\\nthy sight: I have learned, by experience, that\\nGod hath blessed me for thy sake.\\n28Appoint thy wages which I shall give thee.\\n29But he answered: Thou knowest how I have\\nserved thee, and how great thy possession hath\\nbeen in my hands.\\n30Thou hadst but little before I came to thee,\\nand now thou art become rich: and the Lord\\nhath blessed thee at my coming. It is reasonable,\\ntherefore, that I should now provide also for my\\nown house.\\n31And Laban said: What shall I give thee?\\nBut he said: I require nothing; but if thou wilt\\ndo what I demand, I will feed and keep thy sheep\\nagain.\\n32Go round through all thy \\rocks, and sepa-\\nrate all the sheep of divers colours, and speckled;\\nand all that is brown and spotted, and of divers\\ncolours, as well among the sheep as among the\\ngoats, shall be my wages.\\n33And my justice shall answer for me tomor-\\nrow before thee, when the time of the bargain\\nshall come; and all that is not of divers colours,\\nand spotted, and brown, as well among the sheep\\nas among the goats, shall accurse me of theft.\\n34And Laban said: I like well what thou de-\\nmandest.\\n35And he separated the same day the she\\ngoats, and the sheep, and the he goats, and the\\nrams of divers colours, and spotted; and all the\\n\\rock of one colour, that is, of white and black\\n\\reece, he deliverdd into the hands of his sons.\\n36And he set the space of three days journey\\nbetwixt himself and his son in law, who fed the\\nrest of his \\rock.\\n37And Jacob took green rods of poplar, and\\nof almond, and of plane trees, and pilled them\\nin part: so when the bark was taken o\\x0b, in the\\nparts that were pilled, there appeared whiteness:\\nbut the parts that were whole, remained green:\\nand by this means the colour was divers.\\n38And he put them in the troughs, where\\nthe water was poured out; that when the \\rocks\\nshould come to drink, they might have the rods\\nbefore their eyes, and in the sight of them might\\nconceive.\\n39And it came to pass, that in the very\\nheat of coition, the sheep beheld the rods, and\\nbrought forth spotted, and of divers colours, and\\nspeckled.\\n40And Jacob separated the \\rock, and put the\\nrods in the troughs before the eyes of the rams;\\nand all the white and the black were Laban's,\\nand the rest were Jacob's, when the \\rocks were\\nseparated one from the other.\\n41So when the ewes went \\x0crst to ram, Ja-\\ncob put the rods in the troughs of water before\\nthe eyes of the rams, and of the ewes, that they\\nmight conceive while they were looking upon\\nthem.\\n42But when the later coming was, and the\\nlast conceiving, he did not put them. And those\\nthat were lateward, became Laban's; and they\\nof the \\x0crst time, Jacob's.\\n43And the man was enriched exceedingly, and\\nhe had many \\rocks, maidservants and menser-\\nvants, camels and asses.\\nChapter 31\\nBut after that he had heard the words of the\\nsons of Laban, saying: Jacob hath taken away\\nall that was our father's, and being enriched by\\nhis substance is become great.2And perceiving also, that Laban's counte-\\nnance was not towards him as yesterday and the\\nother day.\\n3Especially the Lord saying to him: Return\\ninto the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred,\\nand I will be with thee.\\n4He sent, and called Rachel and Lia into the\\n\\x0celd, where he fed the \\rocks,\\n5And said to them: I see your father's coun-\\ntenance is not towards me as yesterday and the\\nother day: but the God of my father hath been\\nwith me.\\n6And you know that I have served your father\\nto the uttermost of my power.\\n7Yea your father hath also overreached me,\\nand hath changed my wages ten times: and yet\\nGod hath not su\\x0bered him to hurt me.\\n8If at any time, he said: The speckled shall be\\nthy wages: all the sheep brought forth speckled:\\nbut when he said on the contrary: Thou shalt\\ntake all the white one for thy wages: all the \\rocks\\nbrought forth white ones.\\n9And God hath taken your father's sub-\\nstance, and given it to me.\\n10For after the time came of the ewes conceiv-\\ning, I lifted up my eyes, and saw in my sleep, that\\nthe males which leaped upon the females were of\\ndivers colours, and spotted, and speckled.\\n11And the angel of God said to me in my\\nsleep: Jacob. And I answered: Here I am.\\n12And he said: Lift up thy eyes, and see that\\nall the males leaping upon the females, are of\\ndivers colours, spotted and speckled. For I have\\nseen all that Laban hath done to thee.\\n13I am the God of Bethel, where thou didst\\nanoint the stone, and make a vow to me. Now\\ntherefore arise, and go out of this land, and re-\\nturn into thy native country.\\n14And Rachel and Lia answered: Have we\\nany thing left among the goods and inheritance\\nof our father's house?\\n15Hath he not counted us as strangers, and\\nsold us, and eaten up the price of us?\\n16But God hath taken our father's riches, and\\ndelivered them to us, and to our children: where-\\nfore, do all that God hath commanded thee.\\n17Then Jacob rose up, and having set his\\nchildren and wives upon camels, went his way.\\n18And he took all his substance, and \\rocks,\\nand whatsoever he had gotten in Mesopotamia,\\nand went forward to Isaac, his father, to the land\\nof Chanaan.\\n19At that time Laban was gone to shear his\\nsheep, and Rachel stole away her father's idols.\\n20And Jacob would not confess to his father\\nin law that he was \\rying away.\\n21And when he was gone, together with all\\nthat belonged to him, and having passed the\\nriver, was going on towards mount Galaad,\\n22It was told Laban on the third day, that\\nJacob \\red.\\n23And he took his brethren with him, and\\npursued after him seven days; and overtook him\\nin the mount of Galaad.\\n24And he saw in a dream God, saying to\\nhim: Take heed thou speak not any thing harshly\\nagainst Jacob.\\n25Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the\\nmountain: and when he, with his brethren, had\\novertaken him, he pitched his tent in the same\\nmount of Galaad.\\n26And he said to Jacob: Why hast thou done\\nthus, to carry away, without my knowledge, my\\ndaughters as captives taken with the sword?\\n27Why wouldst thou run away privately, and\\nnot acquaint me, that I might have brought thee\\non the way with joy, and with songs, and with\\ntimbrels, and with harps?\\n28Thou hast not su\\x0bered me to kiss my sons\\nand daughters; thou hast done foolishly; and nowindeed,\\n29It is in my power to return thee evil; but the\\nGod of your father said to me yesterday: Take\\nheed thou speak not any thing harshly against\\nJacob.\\n30Suppose thou didst desire to go to thy\\nfriends, and hadst a longing after thy father's\\nhouse: why hast thou stolen away my gods?\\n31Jacob answered: That I departed unknown\\nto thee, it was for fear lest thou wouldst take\\naway thy daughters by force.\\n32But, whereas, thou chargest me with theft:\\nwith whomsoever thou shalt \\x0cnd thy gods, let\\nhim be slain before our brethren. Search, and if\\nthou \\x0cnd any of thy things with me, take them\\naway. Now when he said this, he knew not that\\nRachel had stolen the idols.\\n33So Laban went into the tent of Jacob,\\nand of Lia, and of both the handmaids, and\\nfound them not. And when he was entered into\\nRachel's tent,\\n34She, in haste, hid the idols under the\\ncamel's furniture, and sat upon them: and when\\nhe had searched all the tent, and found nothing,\\n35She said: Let not my lord be angry that\\nI cannot rise up before thee, because it has\\nnow happened to me according to the custom\\nof women. So his careful search was in vain.\\n36And Jacob being angry, said in a chiding\\nmanner: For what fault of mine, and for what\\no\\x0bence on my part hast thou so hotly pursued\\nme,\\n37And searched all my household stu\\x0b?\\nWhat hast thou found of all the substance of thy\\nhouse? lay it here before my brethren, and thy\\nbrethren, and let them judge between me and\\nthee.\\n38Have I, therefore, been with thee twenty\\nyears? thy ewes and goats were not barren, the\\nrams of thy \\rocks I did not eat:\\n39Neither did I shew thee that which the\\nbeast had torn; I made good all the damage:\\nwhatsoever was lost by theft, thou didst exact it\\nof me:\\n40Day and night was I parched with heat, and\\nwith frost, and sleep departed from my eyes.\\n41And in this manner have I served thee in\\nthy house twenty years, fourteen for thy daugh-\\nters, and six for thy \\rocks: thou hast changed\\nalso my wages ten times.\\n42Unless the God of my father, Abraham,\\nand the fear of Isaac, had stood by me, peradven-\\nture now thou hadst sent me away naked: God\\nbeheld my a\\x0fiction and the labour of my hands,\\nand rebuked thee yesterday.\\n43Laban answered him: The daughters are\\nmine, and the children, and thy \\rocks, and all\\nthings that thou seest are mine: what can I do\\nto my children, and grandchildren?\\n44Come, therefore, let us enter into a league;\\nthat it may be for a testimony between me and\\nthee.\\n45And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for\\na title.\\n46And he said to his brethren: Bring hither\\nstones. And they, gathering stones together,\\nmade a heap, and they ate upon it.\\n47And Laban called it, The witness heap; and\\nJacob, The hillock of testimony: each of them\\naccording to the propriety of his language.\\n48And Laban said: This heap shall be a wit-\\nness between me and thee this day, and therefore\\nthe name thereof was called Galaad, that is, The\\nwitness heap.\\n49The Lord behold and judge between us,\\nwhen we shall be gone one from the other.\\n50If thou a\\x0fict my daughters, and if thou\\nbring in other wives over them: none is witness\\nof our speech but God, who is present and be-\\nholdeth.51And he said again to Jacob: Behold this\\nheap, and the stone which I have set up between\\nme and thee,\\n52Shall be a witness: this heap, I say, and\\nthe stone, be they for a testimony, if either I\\nshall pass beyond it going towards thee, or thou\\nshalt pass beyond it thinking harm to me.\\n53The God of Abraham, and the God of Na-\\nchor, the God of their father, judge betweeen us.\\nAnd Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac:\\n54And after he had o\\x0bered sacri\\x0cces in the\\nmountain, he called his brethren to eat bread.\\nAnd when they had eaten, they lodged there:\\n55But Laban arose in the night, and kissed\\nhis sons and daughters, and blessed them: and\\nreturned to his place.\\nChapter 32\\nJacob also went on the journey he had begun:\\nand the angels of God met him.\\n2And when he saw them, he said: These are\\nthe camps of God, and he called the name of\\nthat place Mahanaim, that is, Camps.\\n3And he sent messengers before him to Esau,\\nhis brother, to the land of Seir, to the country of\\nEdom:\\n4And he commanded them, saying: Thus\\nshall ye speak to my lord Esau: Thus saith thy\\nbrother Jacob: I have sojourned with Laban, and\\nhave been with him until this day:\\n5I have oxen, and asses, and sheep, and\\nmenservants, and womenservants: and now I\\nsend a message to my lord, that I may \\x0cnd favour\\nin thy sight.\\n6And the messengers returned to Jacob, say-\\ning: We came to Esau, thy brother, and behold\\nhe cometh with speed to meet thee with four\\nhundred men.\\n7Then Jacob was greatly afraid; and in his\\nfear divided the people that was with him, and\\nthe \\rocks, and the sheep, and the oxen, and the\\ncamels, into two companies,\\n8Saying: If Esau come to one company, and\\ndestroy it, the other company that is left, shall\\nescape.\\n9And Jacob said: O God of my fahter Abra-\\nham, and God of my father Isaac: O Lord who\\nsaidst to me, Return to thy land, and to the place\\nof thy birth, and I will do well for thee.\\n10I am not worthy of the least of all thy mer-\\ncies, and of thy truth which thou hast ful\\x0clled\\nto thy servant. With my sta\\x0b I passed over this\\nJordan; and now I return with two companies.\\n11Deliver me from the hand of my brother\\nEsau, for I am greatly afraid of him; lest perhaps\\nhe come, and kill the mother with the children.\\n12Thou didst say, that thou wouldst do well\\nby me, and multiply my seed like the sand of the\\nsea, which connot be numbered for multitude.\\n13And when he had slept there that night, he\\nset apart, of the things which he had, presents\\nfor his brother Esau,\\n14Two hundred she goats, twenty he goats,\\ntwo hundred ewes, and twenty rams,\\n15Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty\\nkine, and twenty bulls, twenty she asses, and ten\\nof their foals.\\n16And he sent them by the hands of his ser-\\nvants, every drove by itself, and he said to his\\nservants: Go before me, and let there be a space\\nbetween drove and drove.\\n17And he commanded the \\x0crst, saying: If\\nthou meet my brother Esau, and he ask thee:\\nWhose art thou? or whither goest thou? or\\nwhose are these before thee?\\n18Thou shalt answer: Thy servant Jacob's:\\nhe hath sent them as a present to my lord Esau;\\nand he cometh after us.19In like manner he commanded the second,\\nand the third, and all that followed the droves,\\nsaying: Speak ye the same words to Esau, when\\nye \\x0cnd him.\\n20And ye shall add: Thy servant Jacob him-\\nself also followeth after us; for he said: I will\\nappease him with the presents that go before,\\nand afterwards I will see him, perhaps he will be\\ngracious to me.\\n21So the presents went before him, but him-\\nself lodged that night in the camp.\\n22And rising early, he took his two wives and\\nhis two handmaids, with his eleven sons, and\\npassed over the ford of Jaboc.\\n23And when all things were brought over that\\nbelonged to him,\\n24He remained alone; and behold, a man\\nwrestled with him till morning.\\n25And when he saw that he could not over-\\ncome him, he touched the sinew of his thigh, and\\nforthwith it shrank.\\n26And he said to him: Let me go, for it is\\nbreak of day. He answered: I will not let thee\\ngo, except thou bless me.\\n27And he said: What is thy name? He an-\\nswered: Jacob.\\n28But he said: Thy name shall not be called\\nJacob, but Israel; for if thou hast been strong\\nagainst God, how much more shalt thou prevail\\nagainst men?\\n29Jacob asked him: Tell me by what name\\nart thou called? He answered: Why dost thou\\nask my name? And he blessed him in the same\\nplace.\\n30And Jacob called the name of the place\\nPhanuel, saying: I have seen God face to face,\\nand my soul has been saved.\\n31And immediately the sun rose upon him,\\nafter he was past Phanuel; but he halted on his\\nfoot.\\n32Therefore the children of Israel, unto this\\nday, eat not the sinew, that shrank in Jacob's\\nthigh: because he touched the sinew of his thigh\\nand it shrank.\\nChapter 33\\nAnd Jacob lifting up his eyes, saw Esau coming,\\nand with him four hundred men: and he divided\\nthe children of Lia and of Rachel, and of the two\\nhandmaids.\\n2And he put both the handmaids and their\\nchildren foremost: and Lia and her children in\\nthe second place: and Rachel and Joseph last.\\n3And he went forward and bowed down with\\nhis face to the ground seven times, until his\\nbrother came near.\\n4Then Esau ran to meet his brother, and em-\\nbraced him: and clasping him fast about the\\nneck, and kissing him, wept.\\n5And lifting up his eyes, he saw the women\\nand their children, and said: What mean these?\\nAnd do they belong to thee? He answered: They\\nare the children which God hath given to me, thy\\nservant.\\n6Then the handmaids and their children came\\nnear and bowed themselves.\\n7Lia also, with her children, came near and\\nbowed down in like manner; and last of all,\\nJoseph and Rachel bowed down.\\n8And Esau said: What are the droves that\\nI met? He answered: That I might \\x0cnd favour\\nbefore my lord.\\n9But he said: I have plenty, my brother, keep\\nwhat is thine for thyself.\\n10And Jacob said: Do not so I beseech thee,\\nbut if I have found favour in thy eyes, receive a\\nlittle present at my hands: for I have seen thy\\nface, as if I should have seen the countenance ofGod: be gracious to me,\\n11And take the blessing which I have brought\\nthee, and which God hath given me, who giveth\\nall things. He took it with much ado at his\\nbrother's earnest pressing him,\\n12And said: Let us go on together, and I will\\naccompany thee in thy journey.\\n13And Jacob said: My lord, thou knowest\\nthat I have with me tender children, and sheep,\\nand kine with young: which if I should cause to\\nbe overdriven, in one day all the \\rocks will die.\\n14May it please my lord to go before his ser-\\nvant: and I will follow softly after him, as I shall\\nsee my children to be able, until I come to my\\nlord in Seir.\\n15Esau answered: I beseech thee, that some\\nof the people, at least, who are with me, may\\nstay to accompany thee in the way. And he said:\\nThere is no necessity: I want nothing else but\\nonly to \\x0cnd favour, my lord, in thy sight.\\n16So Esau returned that day, the way that\\nhe came, to Seir.\\n17And Jacob came to Socoth: where having\\nbuilt a house, and pitched tents, he called the\\nname of the place Socoth, that is, Tents.\\n18And he passed over to Salem, a city of the\\nSichemites, which is in the land of Chanaan, af-\\nter he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria: and\\nhe dwelt by the town.\\n19And he bought that part of the \\x0celd, in\\nwhich he pitched his tents, of the children of\\nHemor, the father of Sichem, for a hundred\\nlambs.\\n20And raising an altar there, he invoked upon\\nit the most mighty God of Israel.\\nChapter 34\\nAnd Dina the daughter of Lia went out to see\\nthe women of that country.\\n2And when Sichem the son of Hemor the\\nHevite, the prince of that land, saw her, he was\\nin love with her: and took her away, and lay with\\nher, ravishing the virgin.\\n3And his soul was fast knit unto her; and\\nwhereas she was sad, he comforted her with\\nsweet words.\\n4And going to Hemor his father, he said: Get\\nme this damsel to wife.\\n5But when Jacob had heard this, his sons\\nbeing absent, and employed in feeding the cattle,\\nhe held his peace till they came back.\\n6And when Hemor the father of Sichem was\\ncome out to speak to Jacob,\\n7Behold his sons came from the \\x0celd: and\\nhearing what had passed, they were exceeding\\nangry, because he had done a foul thing in Israel,\\nand committed an unlawful act, in ravishing Ja-\\ncob's daughter.\\n8And Hemor spoke to them: The soul of my\\nson Sichem has a longing for your daughter: give\\nher him to wife:\\n9And let us contract marriages one with an-\\nother: give us your daughters, and take you our\\ndaughters.\\n10And dwell with us: the land is at your\\ncommand, till, trade, and possess it.\\n11Sichem also said to her father and to her\\nbrethren: Let me \\x0cnd favour in your sight, and\\nwhatsoever you shall appoint I will give:\\n12Raise the dowry, and ask gifts, and I will\\ngladly give what you shall demand: only give me\\nthis damsel to wife.\\n13The sons of Jacob answered Sichem and his\\nfather deceitfully, being enraged at the de\\rower-\\ning of their sister:14We cannot do what you demand, nor give\\nour sister to one that is uncircumcised; which\\nwith us is unlawful and abominable.\\n15But in this we may be allied with you, if\\nyou will be like us, and all the male sex among\\nyou be circumcised:\\n16Then will we mutually give and take your\\ndaughters, and ours; and we will dwell with you,\\nand will be one people:\\n17But if you will not be circumcised, we will\\ntake our daughter and depart.\\n18Their o\\x0ber pleased Hemor, and Sichem, his\\nson:\\n19And the young man made no delay, but\\nforthwith ful\\x0clled what was required: for he\\nloved the damsel exceedingly, and he was the\\ngreatest man in all his father's house.\\n20And going into the gate of the city, they\\nspoke to the people:\\n21These men are peaceable, and are willing\\nto dwell with us: let them trade in the land, and\\ntill it, which being large and wide wanteth men\\nto till it: we shall take their daughters for wives,\\nand we will give them ours.\\n22One thing there is for which so great a\\ngood is deferred: We must circumcise every male\\namong us, following the manner of the nation.\\n23And their substance, and cattle, and all\\nthat they possess, shall be ours; only in this let us\\ncondescend, and by dwelling together, we shall\\nmake one people.\\n24And they all agreed, and circumcised all\\nthe males.\\n25And behold the third day, when the pain\\nof the wound was greatest: two of the sons of\\nJacob, Simeon and Levi, the brothers of Dina,\\ntaking their swords, entered boldly into the city\\nand slew all the men.\\n26And they killed also Hemor and Sichem,\\nand took away their sister Dina out of Sichem's\\nhouse.\\n27And when they were gone out, the other\\nsons of Jacob came upon the slain; and plun-\\ndered the city in revenge of the rape.\\n28And they took their sheep, and their herds,\\nand their asses, wasting all they had in their\\nhouses and in their \\x0celds.\\n29And their children and wives they took\\ncaptive.\\n30And when they had boldly perpetrated\\nthese things, Jacob said to Simeon and Levi: You\\nhave troubled me, and made me hateful to the\\nChanaanites and Pherezites, the inhabitants of\\nthis land. We are few: they will gather them-\\nselves together and kill me; and both I, and my\\nhouse shall be destroyed.\\n31They answered: Should they abuse our sis-\\nter as a strumpet?\\nChapter 35\\nIn the mean time God said to Jacob: Arise and\\ngo up to Bethel, and dwell there, and make there\\nan altar to God, who appeared to thee when thou\\ndidst \\ree from Esau, thy brother.\\n2And Jacob having called together all his\\nhousehold, said: Cast away the strange gods that\\nare among you, and be cleansed, and change your\\ngarments.\\n3Arise, and let us go up to Bethel, that we\\nmay make there an altar to God; who heard me\\nin the day of my a\\x0fiction, and accompained me\\nin my journey.\\n4So they gave him all the strange gods they\\nhad, and the earrings which were in their ears:\\nand he buried them under the turpentine tree,\\nthat is behind the city of Sichem.\\n5And when they were departed, the terror\\nof God fell upon all the cities round about, andthey durst not pursue after them as they went\\naway.\\n6And Jacob came to Luza, which is in the\\nland of Chanaan, surnamed Bethel: he and all\\nthe people that were with him.\\n7And he built there an altar, and called the\\nname of that place, The house of God: for there\\nGod appeared to him when he \\red from his\\nbrother.\\n8At the same time Debora, the nurse of Re-\\nbecca, died, and was buried at the foot of Bethel,\\nunder an oak, and the name of that place was\\ncalled, The oak of weeping.\\n9And God appeared again to Jacob, after\\nhe returned from Mesopotamia of Syria, and he\\nblessed him,\\n10Saying: Thou shalt not be called any more\\nJacob, but Israel shall be thy name. And he\\ncalled him Israel.\\n11And said to him: I am God almighty, in-\\ncrease thou and be multiplied. Nations and peo-\\nples of nations shall be from thee, and kings shall\\ncome out of thy loins.\\n12And the land which I gave to Abraham and\\nIsaac, I will give to thee, and to thy seed after\\nthee.\\n13And he departed from him.\\n14But he set up a monument of stone, in the\\nplace where God had spoken to him: pouring\\ndrink \\x0berings upon it, and pouring oil thereon:\\n15And calling the name of that place Bethel.\\n16And going forth from thence, he came in\\nthe spring time to the land which leadeth to\\nEphrata: wherein when Rachel was in travail,\\n17By reason of her hard labour, she began to\\nbe in danger, and the midwife said to her: Fear\\nnot, for thou shalt have this son also.\\n18And when her soul was departing for pain,\\nand death was now at hand, she called the name\\nof her son Benoni, that is, the son of my pain:\\nbut his father called him Benjamin, that is, the\\nson of the right hand.\\n19So Rachel died, and was buried in the high-\\nway that leadeth to Ephrata, this is Bethlehem.\\n20And Jacob erected a pillar over her sepul-\\nchre: this is the pillar of Rachel's monument, to\\nthis day.\\n21Departing thence, he pitched his tent be-\\nyond the Flock tower.\\n22And when he dwelt in that country, Ruben\\nwent, and slept with Bala the concubine of his\\nfather: which he was not ignorant of. Now the\\nsons of Jacob were twelve.\\n23The sons of Lia: Ruben the \\x0crst born, and\\nSimeon, and Levi, and Juda, and Issachar, and\\nZabulon.\\n24The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.\\n25The sons of Bala, Rachel's handmaid: Dan\\nand Nephthali.\\n26The sons of Zelpha, Lia's handmaid: Gad\\nand Aser: these are the sons of Jacob, that were\\nborn to him in Mesopotamia of Syria.\\n27And he came to Isaac his father in Mam-\\nbre, the city of Arbee, this is Hebron: wherein\\nAbraham and Isaac sojourned.\\n28And the days of Isaac were a hundred and\\neighty years.\\n29And being spent with age he died, and was\\ngathered to his people, being old and full of days:\\nand his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.\\nChapter 36\\nAnd these are the generations of Esau, the same\\nis Edom.\\n2Esau took wives of the daughters of\\nChanaan: Ada the daughter of Elon the Hethite,\\nand Oolibama the daughter of Ana, the daughter\\nof Sebeon the Hevite:3And Basemath, the daughter of Ismael, sis-\\nter of Nabajoth.\\n4And Ada bore Eliphaz: Basemath bore\\nRahuel.\\n5Oolibama bore Jehus, and Ihelon, and Core.\\nThese are the sons of Esau, that were born to\\nhim in the land of Chanaan.\\n6And Esau took his wives, and his sons and\\ndaughters, and every soul of his house, and his\\nsubstance, and cattle, and all that he was able\\nto acquire in the land of Chanaan: and went into\\nanother country, and departed from his brother\\nJacob.\\n7For they were exceeding rich, and could not\\ndwell together: neither was the land in which\\nthey sojourned able to bear them, for the multi-\\ntude of their \\rocks.\\n8And Esau dwelt in mount Seir: he is Edom.\\n9And these are the generations of Esau, the\\nfather of Edom, in mount Seir.\\n10And these the names of his sons: Eliphaz\\nthe son of Ada, the wife of Esau: and Rahuel,\\nthe son of Basemath, his wife.\\n11And Eliphaz had sons: Theman, Omar,\\nSepho, and Gatham and Cenez.\\n12And Thamna was the concubine of Eliphaz,\\nthe son of Esau: and she bore him Amalech.\\nThese are the sons of Ada, the wife of Esau.\\n13And the sons of Rahuel were Nahath and\\nZara, Samma and Meza. These were the sons of\\nBasemath, the wife of Esau.\\n14And these were the sons of Oolibama, the\\ndaughter of Ana, the daughter of Sebeon, the\\nwife of Esau, whom she bore to him, Jehus, and\\nIhelon, and Core.\\n15These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the\\nsons of Eliphaz, the \\x0crstborn of Esau: duke The-\\nman, duke Omar, duke Sepho, duke Cenez,\\n16Duke Core, duke Gatham, duke Amalech:\\nthese are the sons of Eliphaz, in the land of\\nEdom, and these the sons of Ada.\\n17And these were the sons of Rahuel, the son\\nof Esau: duke Nahath, duke Zara, duke Samma,\\nduke Meza. And these are the dukes of Rahuel,\\nin the land of Edom: these the sons of Basemath,\\nthe wife of Esau.\\n18And these the sons of Oolibama, the wife\\nof Esau: duke Jehus, duke Ihelon, duke Core.\\nThese are the dukes of Oolibama, the daughter\\nof Ana, and wife of Esau.\\n19These are the sons of Esau, and these the\\ndukes of them: the same is Edom.\\n20These are the sons of Seir, the Horrite, the\\ninhabitants of the land: Lotan, and Sobal, and\\nSebeon, and Ana,\\n21And Dison, and Eser, and Disan. These\\nare dukes of the Horrites, the sons of Seir, in the\\nland of Edom.\\n22And Lotan had sons: Hori and Heman.\\nAnd the sister of Lotan was Thamna.\\n23And these the sons of Sobal: Alvan, and\\nManahat, and Ebal, and Sepho, and Onam.\\n24And these the sons of Sebeon: Aia and\\nAna.

And Joseph went forward\\nafter his brethren, and found them in Dothain.\\n18And when they saw him afar o\\x0b, before he\\ncame nigh them, they thought to kill him:\\n19And said one to another: Behold the\\ndreamer cometh.\\n20Come, let us kill him, and cast him into\\nsome old pit: and we will say: Some evil beast\\nhath devoured him: and then it shall appear\\nwhat his dreams avail him:\\n21And Ruben hearing this, endeavoured to\\ndeliver him out of their hands, and said:\\n22Do not take away his life, nor shed his\\nblood: but cast him into this pit, that is in the\\nwilderness, and keep your hands harmless: now\\nhe said this, being desirous to deliver him out of\\ntheir hands and to restore him to his father.\\n23And as soon as he came to his brethren,\\nthey forthwith stript him of his outside coat, that\\nwas of divers colours:\\n24And cast him into an old pit where there\\nwas not water.\\n25And sitting down to eat bread, they\\nsaw some Ismaelites on their way coming from\\nGalaad, with their camels, carrying spices, and\\nbalm, and myrrh to Egypt.\\n26And Juda said to his brethren: What will\\nit pro\\x0ct us to kill our brother, and conceal his\\nblood?\\n27It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites,\\nand that our hands be not de\\x0cled: for he is our\\nbrother and our \\resh. His brethren agreed to his\\nwords.\\n28And when the Madianite merchants passed\\nby, they drew him out of the pit, and sold him\\nto the Ismaelites, for twenty pieces of silver: and\\nthey led him into Egypt.\\n29And Ruben returning to the pit, found not\\nthe boy:\\n30And rending his garments he went to his\\nbrethren, and said: The boy doth not appear,\\nand whither shall I go?\\n31And they took his coat, and dipped it in\\nthe blood of a kid, which they had killed:\\n32Sending some to carry it to their father,\\nand to say: This we have found: see whether it\\nbe thy son's coat, or not.\\n33And the father acknowledging it, said: It\\nis my son's coat, an evil wild beast hath eaten\\nhim, a beast hath devoured Joseph.\\n34And tearing his garments, he put on sack-\\ncloth, mourning for his son a long time.\\n35And all his children being gathered to-\\ngether to comfort their father in his sorrow, he\\nwould not receive comfort, but said: I will go\\ndown to my son into hell, mourning. And whilst\\nhe continued weeping,\\n36The Madianites sold Joseph in Egypt to\\nPutiphar, an eunuch of Pharao, captain of the\\nsoldiers.\\nChapter 38\\nAt that time Juda went down from his brethren,\\nand turned in to a certain Odollamite, named\\nHiras.\\n2And he saw there the daughter of a man of\\nChanaan, called Sue: and taking her to wife, he\\nwent in unto her.3And she conceived, and bore a son, and\\ncalled his name Her.\\n4And conceiving again, she bore a son, and\\ncalled him Onan.\\n5She bore also a third: whom she called Sela.\\nAfter whose birth, she ceased to bear any more.\\n6And Juda took a wife for Her, his \\x0crst born,\\nwhose name was Thamar.\\n7And Her, the \\x0crst born of Juda, was wicked\\nin the sight of the Lord: and was slain by him.\\n8Juda, therefore, said to Onan his son: Go in\\nto thy brother's wife and marry her, that thou\\nmayst raise seed to thy brother.\\n9He knowing that the children should not be\\nhis, when he went in to his brother's wife, he\\nspilled his seed upon the ground, lest children\\nshould be born in his brother's name.\\n10And therefore the Lord slew him, because\\nhe did a detestable thing:\\n11Wherefore Juda said to Thamar his\\ndaughter-in-law: Remain a widow in thy father's\\nhouse, till Sela my son grow up: for he was afraid\\nlest he also might die, as his brethren did. She\\nwent her way, and dwelt in her father's house.\\n12And after many days were past: the daugh-\\nter of Sue the wife of Juda died: and when he\\nhad taken comfort after his mourning, he went\\nup to Thamnas, to the shearers of his sheep, he\\nand Hiras the Odollamite, the shepherd of his\\n\\rock.\\n13And it was told Thamar that her father-in-\\nlaw was come up to Thamnas to shear his sheep.\\n14And she put o\\x0b the garments of her widow-\\nhood, and took a veil: and changing her dress,\\nsat in the cross way, that leadeth to Thamnas:\\nbecause Sela was grown up, and she had not been\\nmarried to him.\\n15When Juda saw her, he thought she was\\na harlot: for she had covered her face, lest she\\nshould be known.\\n16And going to her, he said: Su\\x0ber me to\\nlie with thee: for he knew her not to be his\\ndaughter-in-law. And she answered: What wilt\\nthou give me to enjoy my company?\\n17He said: I will send thee a kid out of the\\n\\rock. And when she said again: I will su\\x0ber\\nwhat thou wilt, if thou give me a pledge, till\\nthou send what thou promisest.\\n18Juda said: What wilt thou have for a\\npledge? She answered: Thy ring and bracelet,\\nand the sta\\x0b which thou holdest in thy hand.\\nThe woman therefore at one copulation con-\\nceived.\\n19And she arose and went her way: and\\nputting o\\x0b the apparel which she had taken, put\\non the garments of her widowhood.\\n20And Juda sent a kid by his shepherd, the\\nOdollamite, that he might receive the pledge\\nagain, which he had given to the woman: but\\nhe, not \\x0cnding her,\\n21Asked the men of that place: Where is the\\nwoman that sat in the cross way? And when\\nthey all made answer: There was no harlot in\\nthis place,\\n22He returned to Juda, and said to him: I\\nhave not found her; moreover, the men of that\\nplace said to me, that there never sat a harlot\\nthere.\\n23Juda said: Let her take it to herself, surely\\nshe cannot charge us with a lie, I sent the kid\\nwhich I promised: and thou didst not \\x0cnd her.\\n24And behold, after three months, they told\\nJuda, saying: Thamar, thy daughter-in-law,\\nhath played the harlot, and she appeareth to\\nhave a big belly. And Juda said: Bring her out\\nthat she may be burnt.\\n25But when she was led to execution, she\\nsent to her father in law, saying: By the man, to\\nwhom these things belong, I am with child. See\\nwhose ring, and bracelet, and sta\\x0b this is.26But he acknowledging the gifts, said: She\\nis juster than I: because I did not give her to\\nSela, my son. However he knew her no more.\\n27And when she was ready to be brought to\\nbed, there appeared twins in her womb: and in\\nthe very delivery of the infants, one put forth a\\nhand, whereon the midwife tied a scarlet thread,\\nsaying:\\n28This shall come forth the \\x0crst.\\n29But he drawing back his hand, the other\\ncame forth: and the woman said: Why is the\\npartition divided for thee? and therefore called\\nhis name Phares.\\n30Afterwards his brother came out, on whose\\nhand was the scarlet thread: and she called his\\nname Zara.\\nChapter 39\\nAnd Joseph was brought into Egypt, and\\nPutiphar, an eunuch of Pharao, chief captain of\\nthe army, an Egyptian, bought him of the Is-\\nmaelites, by whom he was brought.\\n2And the Lord was with him, and he was a\\nprosperous man in all things: and he dwelt in\\nhis master's house:\\n3Who knew very well that the Lord was with\\nhim, and made all that he did to prosper in his\\nhand.\\n4And Joseph found favour in the sight of his\\nmaster, and ministered to him: and being set\\nover all by him, he governed the house commit-\\nted to him, and all things that were delivered to\\nhim:\\n5And the Lord blessed the house of the Egyp-\\ntian for Joseph's sake, and multiplied all his sub-\\nstance, both at home and in the \\x0celds.\\n6Neither knew he any other thing, but the\\nbread which he ate. And Joseph was of a beau-\\ntiful countenance, and comely to behold.\\n7And after many days, his mistress cast her\\neyes on Joseph, and said: Lie with me.\\n8But he in no wise consenting to that wicked\\nact said to her: Behold, my master hath deliv-\\nered all things to me, and knoweth not what he\\nhath in his own house:\\n9Neither is there any thing which is not in\\nmy power, or that he hath not delivered to me,\\nbut thee, who art his wife; how then can I do\\nthis wicked thing, and sin against my God?\\n10With such words as these day by day, both\\nthe woman was importunate with the young\\nman, and he refused the adultery.\\n11Now it happened on a certain day, that\\nJoseph went into the house, and was doing some\\nbusiness, without any man with him:\\n12And she catching the skirt of his garment,\\nsaid: Lie with me. But he leaving the garment\\nin her hand, \\red, and went out.\\n13And when the woman saw the garment in\\nher hands, and herself disregarded,\\n14She called to her the men of her house, and\\nsaid to them: See, he hath brought in a Hebrew,\\nto abuse us: he came in to me, to lie with me;\\nand when I cried out,\\n15And he heard my voice, he left the garment\\nthat I held, and got him out.\\n16For a proof therefore of her \\x0cdelity, she\\nkept the garment, and shewed it to her husband\\nwhen he returned home:\\n17And said: The Hebrew servant, whom thou\\nhast brought, came to me to abuse me.\\n18And when he heard me cry, he left the gar-\\nment which I held, and \\red out.\\n19His master hearing these things, and giving\\ntoo much credit to his wife's words, was very\\nangry,\\n20And cast Joseph into the prison, where the\\nking's prisoners were kept, and he was there shutup.\\n21But the Lord was with Joseph, and having\\nmercy upon him gave him favour in the sight of\\nthe chief keeper of the prison:\\n22Who delivered into his hand all the prison-\\ners that were kept in custody: and whatsoever\\nwas done, was under him.\\n23Neither did he himself know any thing, hav-\\ning committed all things to him: for the Lord\\nwas with him, and made all that he did to pros-\\nper.\\nChapter 40\\nAfter this, it came to pass, that two eunuchs,\\nthe butler and the baker of the king of Egypt,\\no\\x0bended their lord.\\n2And Pharao being angry with them, (now\\nthe one was chief butler, the other chief baker,)\\n3He sent them to the prison of the commander\\nof the soldiers, in which Joseph also was prisoner.\\n4But the keeper of the prison delivered them\\nto Joseph, and he served them. Some little time\\npassed, and they were kept in custody.\\n5And they both dreamed a dream the same\\nnight, according to the interpretation agreeing\\nto themselves:\\n6And when Joseph was come into them in the\\nmorning, and saw them sad,\\n7He asked them, saying: Why is your coun-\\ntenance sadder today than usual?\\n8They answered: We have dreamed a dream,\\nand there is nobody to interpret it to us. And\\nJoseph said to them: Doth not interpretation\\nbelong to God? Tell me what you have dreamed:\\n9The chief butler \\x0crst told his dream: I saw\\nbefore me a vine,\\n10On which were three branches, which by\\nlittle and little sent out buds, and after the blos-\\nsoms brought forth ripe grapes:\\n11And the cup of Pharao was in my hand:\\nand I took the grapes, and pressed them into the\\ncup which I held, and I gave the cup to Pharao.\\n12Joseph answered: This is the interpretation\\nof the dream: The three branches, are yet three\\ndays:\\n13After which Pharao will remember thy ser-\\nvice, and will restore thee to thy former place:\\nand thou shalt present him the cup according to\\nthy o\\x0ece, as before thou was wont to do.\\n14Only remember me when it shall be well\\nwith thee, and do me this kindness: to put\\nPharao in mind to take me out of this prison:\\n15For I was stolen away out of the land of the\\nHebrews, and here without any fault was cast\\ninto the dungeon.\\n16The chief baker seeing that he had wisely\\ninterpreted the dream, said: I also dreamed a\\ndream, That I had three baskets of meal upon\\nmy head:\\n17And that in one basket which was upper-\\nmost, I carried all meats that are made by the\\nart of baking, and that the birds ate out of it.\\n18Joseph answered: This is the interpretation\\nof the dream: The three baskets, are yet three\\ndays:\\n19After which Pharao will take thy head from\\nthee, and hang thee on a cross, and the birds\\nshall tear thy \\resh.\\n20The third day after this was the birthday\\nof Pharao: and he made a great feast for his\\nservants, and at the banquet remembered the\\nchief butler, and the chief baker.\\n21And he restored the one to his place, to\\npresent him the cup:\\n22The other he hanged on a gibbet, that the\\ntruth of the interpreter might be shewn.\\n23But the chief butler, when things prospered\\nwith him, forgot his interpreter.Chapter 41\\nAfter two years Pharao had a dream. He thought\\nhe stood by the river,\\n2Out of which came up seven kine, very beau-\\ntiful and fat: and they fed in marshy places.\\n3Other seven also came up out of the river, ill\\nfavoured, and lean \\reshed: and they fed on the\\nvery bank of the river, in green places:\\n4And they devoured them, whose bodies were\\nvery beautiful and well conditioned. So Pharao\\nawoke.\\n5He slept again, and dreamed another dream:\\nSeven ears of corn came up upon one stalk full\\nand fair:\\n6Then seven other ears sprung up thin and\\nblasted,\\n7And devoured all the beauty of the former.\\nPharao awaked after his rest:\\n8And when morning was come, being struck\\nwith fear, he sent to all the interpreters of Egypt,\\nand to all the wise men: and they being called\\nfor, he told them his dream, and there was not\\nany one that could interpret it.\\n9Then at length the chief butler remember-\\ning, said: I confess my sin:\\n10The king being angry with his servants,\\ncommanded me and the chief baker to be cast\\ninto the prison of the captain of the soldiers.\\n11Where in one night both of us dreamed a\\ndream forboding things to come.\\n12There was there a young man a Hebrew,\\nservant to the same captain of the soldiers: to\\nwhom we told our dreams,\\n13And we heard what afterwards the event\\nof the thing proved to be so. For I was restored\\nto my o\\x0ece: and he was hanged upon a gibbet.\\n14Forthwith at the king's command Joseph\\nwas brought out of the prison, and they shaved\\nhim: and changing his apparel brought him in\\nto him.\\n15And he said to him: I have dreamed\\ndreams, and there is no one that can expound\\nthem: Now I have heard that thou art very wise\\nat interpreting them:\\n16Joseph answered: Without me, God shall\\ngive Pharao a prosperous answer.\\n17So Pharao told what he had dreamed:\\nMethought I stood upon the bank of the river,\\n18And seven kine came up out of the river,\\nexceeding beautiful and full of \\resh: and they\\ngrazed on green places in a marshy pasture.\\n19And behold, there followed these, other\\nseven kine, so very ill favoured and lean, that\\nI never saw the like in the land of Egypt:\\n20And they devoured and consumed the for-\\nmer,\\n21And yet gave no mark of their being full:\\nbut were as lean and ill favoured as before. I\\nawoke, and then fell asleep again,\\n22And dreamed a dream: Seven ears of corn\\ngrew up upon one stalk, full and very fair.\\n23Other seven also thin and blasted, sprung\\nof the stalk:\\n24And they devoured the beauty of the for-\\nmer: I told this dream to the conjecturers, and\\nthere is no man that can expound it.\\n25Joseph answered: The king's dream is one:\\nGod hath shewn to Pharao what he is about to\\ndo.\\n26The seven beautiful kine, and the seven full\\nears, are seven years of plenty: and both contain\\nthe same meaning of the dream.\\n27And the seven lean and thin kine that came\\nup after them, and the seven thin ears that were\\nblasted with the burning wind, are seven years\\nof famine to come:\\n28Which shall be ful\\x0clled in this order.29Behold, there shall come seven years of\\ngreat plenty in the whole land of Egypt:\\n30After which shall follow other seven years\\nof so great scarcity, that all the abundance before\\nshall be forgotten: for the famine shall consume\\nall the land,\\n31And the greatness of the scarcity shall de-\\nstroy the greatness of the plenty.\\n32And for that thou didst see the second time\\na dream pertaining to the same thing: it is a\\ntoken of the certainty, and that the word of God\\ncometh to pass, and is ful\\x0clled speedily.\\n33Now therefore let the king provide a wise\\nand industrious man, and make him ruler over\\nthe land of Egypt:\\n34That he may appoint overseers over all the\\ncountries: and gather into barns the \\x0cfth part of\\nthe fruits, during the seven fruitful years,\\n35That shall now presently ensue: and let all\\nthe corn be laid up, under Pharao's hands, and\\nbe reserved in the cities.\\n36And let it be in readiness, against the\\nfamine of seven years to come, which shall op-\\npress Egypt, and the land shall not be consumed\\nwith scarcity.\\n37The counsel pleased Pharao, and all his\\nservants.\\n38And he said to them: Can we \\x0cnd such\\nanother man, that is full of the spirit of God?\\n39He said therefore to Joseph: Seeing God\\nhath shewn thee all that thou hast said, can I\\n\\x0cnd one wiser and one like unto thee?\\n40Thou shalt be over my house, and at the\\ncommandment of thy mouth all the people shall\\nobey: only in the kingly throne will I be above\\nthee.\\n41And again Pharao said to Joseph: Behold,\\nI have appointed thee over the whole land of\\nEgypt.\\n42And he took his ring from his own hand,\\nand gave it into his hand: and he put upon him\\na robe of silk, and put a chain of gold about his\\nneck.\\n43And he made him go up into his second\\nchariot, the crier proclaiming that all should bow\\ntheir knee before him, and that they should know\\nhe was made governor over the whole land of\\nEgypt.\\n44And the king said to Joseph: I am Pharao:\\nwithout thy commandment no man shall move\\nhand or foot in all the land of Egypt.\\n45And he turned his name, and called him\\nin the Egyptian tongue the saviour of the world.\\nAnd he gave him to wife Aseneth, the daughter\\nof Putiphare, priest of Heliopolis. Then Joseph\\nwent out to the land of Egypt.\\n46(Now he was thirty years old when he stood\\nbefore king Pharao), and he went round all the\\ncountries of Egypt.\\n47And the fruitfulness of the seven years\\ncame: and the corn being bound up into sheaves,\\nwas gathered together into the barns of Egypt.\\n48And all the abundance of grain was laid up\\nin every city.\\n49And there was so great abundance of\\nwheat, that it was equal to the sand of the sea,\\nand the plenty exceeded measure.\\n50And before the famine came, Joseph had\\ntwo sons born: whom Aseneth, the daughter of\\nPutiphare, priest of Heliopolis, bore unto him.\\n51And he called the name of the \\x0crstborn\\nManasses, saying: God hath made me to forget\\nall my labours, and my father's house.\\n52And he named the second Ephraim, saying:\\nGod hath made me to grow in the land of my\\npoverty.\\n53Now when the seven years of plenty that\\nhad been in Egypt were passed:\\n54The seven years of scarcity, which Josephhad foretold, began to come: and the famine\\nprevailed in the whole world, but there was bread\\nin all the land of Egypt.\\n55And when there also they began to be fam-\\nished, the people cried to Pharao, for food. And\\nhe said to them: Go to Joseph: and do all that\\nhe shall say to you.\\n56And the famine increased daily in all the\\nland: and Joseph opened all the barns, and sold\\nto the Egyptians: for the famine had oppressed\\nthem also.\\n57And all provinces came into Egypt, to buy\\nfood, and to seek some relief of their want.\\nChapter 42\\nAnd Jacob hearing that food was sold in Egypt,\\nsaid to his sons: Why are ye careless?\\n2I have heard that wheat is sold in Egypt:\\nGo ye down, and buy us necessaries, that we\\nmay live, and not be consumed with want.\\n3So the ten brethren of Joseph went down, to\\nbuy corn in Egypt:\\n4Whilst Benjamin was kept at home by Ja-\\ncob, who said to his brethren: Lest perhaps he\\ntake any harm in the journey.\\n5And they entered into the land of Egypt with\\nothers that went to buy. For the famine was in\\nthe land of Chanaan.\\n6And Joseph was governor in the land of\\nEgypt, and corn was sold by his direction to the\\npeople. And when his brethren had bowed down\\nto him,\\n7And he knew them, he spoke as it were\\nto strangers, somewhat roughly, asking them:\\nWhence came you? They answered: From the\\nland of Chanaan, to buy necessaries of life.\\n8And though he knew his brethren, he was\\nnot known by them.\\n9And remembering the dreams, which for-\\nmerly he had dreamed, he said to them: You are\\nspies. You are come to view the weaker parts of\\nthe land.\\n10But they said: It is not so, my lord; but\\nthy servants are come to buy food.\\n11We are all the sons of one man: we are\\ncome as peaceable men, neither do thy servants\\ngo about any evil.\\n12And he answered them: It is otherwise:\\nyou are come to consider the unfenced parts of\\nthis land.\\n13But they said: We thy servants are twelve\\nbrethren, the sons of one man in the land of\\nChanaan: the youngest is with our father, the\\nother is not living.\\n14He saith, This is it that I said: You are\\nspies.\\n15I shall now presently try what you are: by\\nthe health of Pharao, you shall not depart hence,\\nuntil your youngest brother come.\\n16Send one of you to fetch him: and you shall\\nbe in prison, till what you have said be proved,\\nwhether it be true or false: or else by the health\\nof Pharao you are spies.\\n17So he put them in prison three days.\\n18And the third day he brought them out of\\nprison, and said: Do as I have said, and you shall\\nlive: for I fear God.\\n19If you be peaceable men, let one of your\\nbrethren be bound in prison: and go ye your\\nways, and carry the corn that you have bought,\\nunto your houses.\\n20And bring your youngest brother to me,\\nthat I may \\x0cnd your words to be true, and you\\nmay not die. They did as he had said.\\n21And they talked one to another: We de-\\nserve to su\\x0ber these things, because we have\\nsinned against our brother, seeing the anguish\\nof his soul, when he besought us, and we wouldnot hear: therefore is this a\\x0fiction come upon\\nus.\\n22And Ruben, one of them, said: Did not I\\nsay to you: Do not sin against the boy; and you\\nwould not hear me? Behold his blood is required.\\n23And they knew not that Joseph under-\\nstood, because he spoke to them by an inter-\\npreter.\\n24And he turned himself away a little while,\\nand wept: and returning, he spoke to them.\\n25And taking Simeon, and binding him in\\ntheir presence, he commanded his servants to \\x0cll\\ntheir sacks with wheat, and to put every man's\\nmoney again in their sacks, and to give them\\nbesides provisions for the way: and they did so.\\n26But they having loaded their asses with the\\ncorn went their way.\\n27And one of them opening his sack, to give\\nhis beast provender in the inn, saw the money in\\nthe sack's mouth,\\n28And said to his brethren: My money is\\ngiven me again; behold it is in the sack. And\\nthey were astonished, and troubled, and said to\\none another: What is this that God hath done\\nunto us?\\n29And they came to Jacob their father in the\\nland of Chanaan, and they told him all things\\nthat had befallen them, saying:\\n30The lord of the land spoke roughly to us,\\nand took us to be spies of the country.\\n31And we answered him: We are peaceable\\nmen, and we mean no plot.\\n32We are twelve brethren born of one father:\\none is not living, the youngest is with our father\\nin the land of Chanaan.\\n33And he said to us: Hereby shall I know\\nthat you are peaceable men: Leave one of your\\nbrethren with me, and take ye necessary provi-\\nsion for your houses, and go your ways,\\n34And bring your youngest brother to me,\\nthat I may know you are not spies: and you may\\nreceive this man again, that is kept in prison:\\nand afterwards may have leave to buy what you\\nwill.\\n35When they had told this, they poured out\\ntheir corn, and every man found his money tied\\nin the mouth of his sack: and all being aston-\\nished together,\\n36Their father Jacob said: You have made\\nme to be without children: Joseph is not living,\\nSimeon is kept in bonds, and Benjamin you will\\ntake away: all these evils are fallen upon me.\\n37And Ruben answered him: Kill my two\\nsons, if I bring him not again to thee: deliver\\nhim into my hand, and I will restore him to thee.\\n38But he said: My son shall not go down with\\nyou: his brother is dead, and he is left alone:\\nif any mischief befall him in the land to which\\nyou go, you will bring down my grey hairs with\\nsorrow to hell.\\nChapter 43\\nIn the mean time the famine was heavy upon all\\nthe land.\\n2And when they had eaten up all the corn,\\nwhich they had brought out of Egypt, Jacob said\\nto his sons: Go again, and buy us a little food.\\n3Juda answered: The man declared unto us\\nwith the attestation of an oath, saying: You shall\\nnot see my face, unless you bring your youngest\\nbrother with you.\\n4If therefore thou wilt send him with us, we\\nwill set out together, and will buy necessaries for\\nthee.\\n5But if thou wilt not, we will not go: for the\\nman, as we have often said, declared unto us,\\nsaying: You shall not see my face without youryoungest brother.\\n6Israel said to them: You have done this for\\nmy misery, in that you told him you had also\\nanother brother.\\n7But they answered: The man asked us in or-\\nder concerning our kindred: if our father lived:\\nif we had a brother: and we answered him reg-\\nularly, according to what he demanded: could\\nwe know that he would say: Bring hither your\\nbrother with you?\\n8And Juda said to his father: Send the boy\\nwith me, that we may set forward, and may live:\\nlest both we and our children perish.\\n9I take the boy upon me, require him at my\\nhand: unless I bring him again, and restore him\\nto thee, I will be guilty of sin against thee for\\never.\\n10If delay had not been made, we had been\\nhere again the second time.\\n11Then Israel said to them: If it must needs\\nbe so, do what you will: take of the best fruits of\\nthe land in your vessels, and carry down presents\\nto the man, a little balm, and honey, and storax,\\nmyrrh, turpentine, and almonds.\\n12And take with you double money, and carry\\nback what you found in your sacks, lest perhaps\\nit was done by mistake.\\n13And take also your brother, and go to the\\nman.\\n14And may my almighty God make him\\nfavourable to you: and send back with you your\\nbrother, whom he keepeth, and this Benjamin:\\nand as for me I shall be desolate without chil-\\ndren.\\n15So the men took the presents, and dou-\\nble money, and Benjamin: and went down into\\nEgypt, and stood before Joseph.\\n16And when he had seen them, and Benjamin\\nwith them, he commanded the steward of his\\nhouse, saying: Bring in the men into the house,\\nand kill victims, and prepare a feast: because\\nthey shall eat with me at noon.\\n17He did as he was commanded, and brought\\nthe men into the house.\\n18And they being much afraid, said there\\none to another: Because of the money, which\\nwe carried back the \\x0crst time in our sacks, we\\nare brought in: that he may bring upon us a\\nfalse accusation, and by violence make slaves of\\nus and our asses.\\n19Wherefore, going up to the steward of the\\nhouse, at the door,\\n20They said: Sir, we desire thee to hear us.\\nWe came down once before to buy food:\\n21And when we had bought, and were come\\nto the inn, we opened our sacks, and found our\\nmoney in the mouths of the sacks: which we have\\nnow brought again in the same weight.\\n22And we have brought other money besides,\\nto buy what we want: we cannot tell who put it\\nin our bags.\\n23But he answered: Peace be with you, fear\\nnot: your God, and the God of your father, hath\\ngiven you treasure in your sacks. For the money,\\nwhich you gave me, I have for good. And he\\nbrought Simeon out to them.\\n24And having brought them into the house,\\nhe fetched water, and they washed their feet, and\\nhe gave provender to their asses.\\n25But they made ready the presents, against\\nJoseph came at noon: for they had heard that\\nthey should eat bread there.\\n26Then Joseph came in to his house, and they\\no\\x0bered him the presents, holding them in their\\nhands; and they bowed down with their face to\\nthe ground.\\n27But he courteously saluting them again,\\nasked them, saying: Is the old man your father\\nin health, of whom you told me? Is he yet living?28And they answered: Thy servant our fa-\\nther, is in health; he is yet living. And bowing\\nthemselves, they made obeisance to him.\\n29And Joseph lifting up his eyes, saw Ben-\\njamin, his brother by the same mother, and said:\\nIs this your young brother, of whom you told me?\\nAnd he said: God be gracious to thee, my son.\\n30And he made haste, because his heart was\\nmoved upon his brother, and tears gushed out:\\nand going into his chamber, he wept.\\n31And when he had washed his face, coming\\nout again, he refrained himself, and said: Set\\nbread on the table.\\n32And when it was set on, for Joseph apart,\\nand for his brethren apart, for the Egyptians also\\nthat ate with him apart, (for it is unlawful for\\nthe Egyptians to eat with the Hebrews, and they\\nthink such a feast profane):\\n33They sat before him, the \\x0crstborn accord-\\ning to his birthright, and the youngest according\\nto his age. And they wondered very much;\\n34Taking the messes which they received of\\nhim: and the greater mess came to Benjamin, so\\nthat it exceeded by \\x0cve parts. And they drank,\\nand were merry with him.\\nChapter 44\\nAnd Joseph commanded the steward of his\\nhouse, saying: Fill their sacks with corn, as much\\nas they can hold: and put the money of every one\\nin the top of his sack.\\n2And in the mouth of the younger's sack put\\nmy silver cup, and the price which he gave for\\nthe wheat. And it was so done.\\n3And when the morning arose, they were sent\\naway with their asses.\\n4And when they were now departed out of the\\ncity, and had gone forward a little way: Joseph\\nsending for the steward of his house, said: Arise,\\nand pursue after the men: and when thou hast\\novertaken them, say to them: Why have you re-\\nturned evil for good?\\n5The cup which you have stolen, is that in\\nwhich my lord drinketh, and in which he is wont\\nto divine: you have done a very evil thing.\\n6He did as he had commanded him. And\\nhaving overtaken them, he spoke to them the\\nsame words.\\n7And they answered: Why doth our lord\\nspeak so, as though thy servants had commit-\\nted so heinous a fact?\\n8The money, that we found in the top of our\\nsacks, we brought back to thee from the land of\\nChanaan: how then should it be that we should\\nsteal out of thy lord's house, gold or silver?\\n9With whomsoever of thy servants shall be\\nfound that which thou seekest, let him die, and\\nwe will be the bondmen of my lord.\\n10And he said to them: Let it be according\\nto your sentence: with whomsoever it shall be\\nfound, let him be my servant, and you shall be\\nblameless.\\n11Then they speedily took down their sacks\\nto the ground, and every man opened his sack.\\n12Which when he had searched, beginning at\\nthe eldest, and ending at the youngest, he found\\nthe cup in Benjamin's sack.\\n13Then they rent their garments, and loading\\ntheir asses again, returned into the town.\\n14And Juda at the head of his brethren went\\nin to Joseph (for he was not yet gone out of the\\nplace) and they all together fell down before him\\non the ground.\\n15And he said to them: Why would you do\\nso? know you not that there is no one like me in\\nthe science of divining.\\n16And Juda said to him: What shall we an-\\nswer my lord? or what shall we say, or be ablejustly to allege? God hath found out the iniq-\\nuity of thy servants: behold, we are all bondmen\\nto my lord, both we, and he with whom the cup\\nwas found.\\n17Joseph answered: God forbid that I should\\ndo so: he that stole the cup, he shall be my\\nbondman: and go you away free to your father.\\n18Then Juda coming nearer, said boldly: I\\nbeseech thee, my lord, let thy servant speak a\\nword in thy ears, and be not angry with thy ser-\\nvant: for after Pharao thou art.\\n19My lord. Thou didst ask thy servants the\\n\\x0crst time: Have you a father or a brother.\\n20And we answered thee, my lord: We have\\na father an old man, and a young boy, that was\\nborn in his old age; whose brother by the mother\\nis dead; and he alone is left of his mother, and\\nhis father loveth him tenderly.\\n21And thou saidst to thy servants: Bring him\\nhither to me, and I will set my eyes on him.\\n22We suggested to my lord: The boy cannot\\nleave his father: for if he leave him, he will die.\\n23And thou saidst to thy servants: Except\\nyour youngest brother come with you, you shall\\nsee my face no more.\\n24Therefore when we were gone up to thy\\nservant our father, we told him all that my lord\\nhad said.\\n25And our father said: Go again, and buy us\\na little wheat.\\n26And we said to him: We cannot go: if our\\nyoungest brother go down with us, we will set\\nout together: otherwise, without him we dare\\nnot see the man's face.\\n27Whereunto he answered: You know that\\nmy wife bore me two.\\n28One went out, and you said: A beast de-\\nvoured him; and hitherto he appeareth not.\\n29If you take this also, and any thing befall\\nhim in the way, you will bring down my grey\\nhairs with sorrow unto hell.\\n30Therefore, if I shall go to thy servant, our\\nfather, and the boy be wanting, (whereas his life\\ndependeth upon the life of him,)\\n31And he shall see that he is not with us, he\\nwill die, and thy servants shall bring down his\\ngrey hairs with sorrow unto hell.\\n32Let me be thy proper servant, who took\\nhim into my trust, and promised, saying: If I\\nbring him not again, I will be guilty of sin against\\nmy father for ever.\\n33Therefore I, thy servant, will stay instead\\nof the boy in the service of my lord, and let the\\nboy go up with his brethren.\\n34For I cannot return to my father without\\nthe boy, lest I be a witness of the calamity that\\nwill oppress my father.\\nChapter 45\\nJoseph could no longer refrain himself before\\nmany that stood by: whereupon he commanded\\nthat all should go out, and no stranger be present\\nat their knowing one another.\\n2And he lifted up his voice with weeping,\\nwhich the Egyptians, and all the house of Pharao\\nheard.\\n3And he said to his brethren: I am Joseph:\\nIs my father yet living? His brethren could not\\nanswer him, being struck with exceeding great\\nfear.\\n4And he said mildly to them: Come nearer\\nto me. And when they were come near him, he\\nsaid: I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold\\ninto Egypt.\\n5Be not afraid, and let it not seem to you a\\nhard case that you sold me into these countries:\\nfor God sent me before you into Egypt for your\\npreservation.6For it is two years since the famine began to\\nbe upon the land, and \\x0cve years more remain,\\nwherein there can be neither ploughing nor reap-\\ning.\\n7And God sent me before, that you may be\\npreserved upon the earth, and may have food to\\nlive.\\n8Not by your counsel was I sent hither, but\\nby the will of God: who hath made me as it were\\na father to Pharao, and lord of his whole house,\\nand governor in all the land of Egypt.\\n9Make haste, and go ye up to my father, and\\nsay to him: Thus saith thy son Joseph: God hath\\nmade me lord of the whole land of Egypt; come\\ndown to me, linger not.\\n10And thou shalt dwell in the land of Gessen:\\nand thou shalt be near me, thou and thy sons,\\nand thy sons' sons, thy sheep, and thy herds, and\\nall things that thou hast.\\n11And there I will feed thee, (for there are\\nyet \\x0cve years of famine remaining) lest both thou\\nperish, and thy house, and all things that thou\\nhast.\\n12Behold, your eyes, and the eyes of my\\nbrother Benjamin, see that it is my mouth that\\nspeaketh to you.\\n13You shall tell my father of all my glory, and\\nall things that you have seen in Egypt: make\\nhaste and bring him to me.\\n14And falling upon the neck of his brother\\nBenjamin, he embraced him and wept: and Ben-\\njamin in like manner wept also on his neck.\\n15And Joseph kissed all his brethren, and\\nwept upon every one of them: after which they\\nwere emboldened to speak to him.\\n16And it was heard, and the fame was spread\\nabroad in the king's court: The brethren of\\nJoseph are come; and Pharao with all his family\\nwas glad.\\n17And he spoke to Joseph that he should give\\norders to his brethren, saying: Load your beasts,\\nand go into the land of Chanaan,\\n18And bring away from thence your father\\nand kindred, and come to me; and I will give\\nyou all the good things of Egypt, that you may\\neat the marrow of the land.\\n19Give orders also that they take wagons out\\nof the land of Egypt, for the carriage of their\\nchildren and their wives; and say: Take up your\\nfather, and make haste to come with all speed:\\n20And leave nothing of your household stu\\x0b;\\nfor all the riches of Egypt shall be yours.\\n21And the sons of Israel did as they were\\nbid. And Joseph gave them wagons according to\\nPharao's commandment: and provisions for the\\nway.\\n22He ordered also to be brought out for every\\none of them two robes: but to Benjamin he gave\\nthree hundred pieces of silver, with \\x0cve robes of\\nthe best:\\n23Sending to his father as much money and\\nraiment; adding besides, ten he asses, to carry o\\x0b\\nall the riches of Egypt, and as many she asses,\\ncarrying wheat and bread for the journey.\\n24So he sent away his brethren, and at their\\ndeparting said to them: Be not angry in the way.\\n25And they went up out of Egypt, and came\\ninto the land of Chanaan, to their father Jacob.\\n26And they told him, saying: Joseph, thy\\nson, is living; and he is ruler in all the land of\\nEgypt. Which when Jacob heard, he awaked as\\nit were out of a deep sleep, yet did not believe\\nthem.\\n27They, on the other side, told the whole\\norder of the thing. And when he saw the wagons,\\nand all that he had sent, his spirit revived,\\n28And he said: It is enough for me if Joseph,\\nmy son, be yet living: I will go and see him before\\nI die.Chapter 46\\nAnd Israel taking his journey, with all that he\\nhad, came to the well of the oath, and killing\\nvictims there to the God of his father Isaac,\\n2He heard him, by a vision in the night, call-\\ning him, and saying to him: Jacob, Jacob. And\\nhe answered him: Lo, here I am.\\n3God said to him: I am the most mighty God\\nof thy father; fear not, go down into Egypt, for\\nI will make a great nation of thee there.\\n4I will go down with thee thither, and will\\nbring thee back again from thence: Joseph also\\nshall put his hands upon thy eyes.\\n5And Jacob rose up from the well of the oath:\\nand his sons took him up, with their children and\\nwives in the wagons, which Pharao had sent to\\ncarry the old man,\\n6And all that he had in the land of Chanaan:\\nand he came into Egypt with all his seed;\\n7His sons, and grandsons, daughters, and all\\nhis o\\x0bspring together.\\n8And these are the names of the children of\\nIsrael, that entered into Egypt, he and his chil-\\ndren. His \\x0crstborn Ruben,\\n9The sons of Ruben: Henoch and Phallu, and\\nHesron and Charmi.\\n10The sons of Simeon: Jamuel and Jamin\\nand Ahod, and Jachin and Sohar, and Saul, the\\nson of a woman of Chanaan.\\n11The sons of Levi: Gerson and Caath, and\\nMerari.\\n12The sons of Juda: Her and Onan, and Sela,\\nand Phares and Zara. And Her and Onan died\\nin the land of Chanaan. And sons were born to\\nPhares: Hesron and Hamul.\\n13The sons of Issachar: Thola and Phua, and\\nJob and Semron.\\n14The sons of Zabulon: Sared, and Elon, and\\nJahelel.\\n15These are the sons of Lia, whom she bore in\\nMesopotamia of Syria, with Dina, his daughter.\\nAll the souls of her sons and daughters, thirty-\\nthree.\\n16The sons of Gad: Sephion and Haggi, and\\nSuni and Esebon, and Heri and Arodi, and Areli.\\n17The sons of Aser: Jamne and Jesua, and\\nJessuri and Beria, and Sara their sister. The\\nsons of Beria: Heber and Melchiel.\\n18These are the sons of Zelpha, whom Laban\\ngave to Lia, his daughter. And these she bore to\\nJacob, sixteen souls.\\n19The sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife: Joseph\\nand Benjamin.\\n20And sons were born to Joseph, in the\\nland of Egypt, whom Aseneth, the daughter of\\nPutiphare, priest of Heliopolis, bore him: Man-\\nasses and Ephraim.\\n21The sons of Benjamin: Bela and Bechor,\\nand Asbel and Gera, and Naaman and Echi, and\\nRoss and Mophim, and Ophim and Ared.\\n22These are the sons of Rachel, whom she\\nbore to Jacob: all the souls, fourteen.\\n23The sons of Dan: Husim.\\n24The sons of Nephthali: Jaziel and Guni,\\nand Jeser and Sallem.\\n25These are the sons of Bala, whom Laban\\ngave to Rachel, his daughter: and these she bore\\nto Jacob: all the souls, seven.\\n26All the souls that went with Jacob into\\nEgypt, and that came out of his thigh, besides\\nhis sons' wives, sixty-six.\\n27And the sons of Joseph, that were born to\\nhim in the land of Egypt, two souls. All the souls\\nof the house of Jacob, that entered into Egypt,\\nwere seventy.\\n28And he sent Juda before him to Joseph, to\\ntell him; and that he should meet him in Gessen.\\n29And when he was come thither, Joseph\\nmade ready his chariot, and went up to meethis father in the same place: and seeing him, he\\nfell upon his neck, and embracing him, wept.\\n30And the father said to Joseph: Now shall\\nI die with joy, becuase I have seen thy face, and\\nleave thee alive.\\n31And Joseph said to his brethren, and to\\nall his father's house: I will go up, and will\\ntell Pharao, and will say to him: My brethren,\\nand my father's house, that were in the land of\\nChanaan, are come to me:\\n32And the men are shepherds, and their oc-\\ncupation is to feed cattle; their \\rocks, and herds,\\nand all they have, they have brought with them.\\n33And when he shall call you, and shall say:\\nWhat is your occupation?\\n34You shall answer: We, thy servants, are\\nshepherds, from our infancy until now, both we\\nand our fathers. And this you shall say, that\\nyou may dwell in the land of Gessen, because the\\nEgyptians have all shepherds in abomination.\\nChapter 47\\nThen Joseph went in and told Pharao, saying:\\nMy father and brethren, their sheep and their\\nherds, and all that they possess, are come out of\\nthe land of Chanaan: and behold they stay in\\nthe land of Gessen.\\n2Five men also, the last of his brethren, he\\npresented before the king:\\n3And he asked them: What is your occu-\\npation? They answered: We, thy servants, are\\nshepherds, both we and our fathers.\\n4We are come to sojourn in thy land, because\\nthere is no grass for the \\rocks of thy servants,\\nthe famine being very grievous in the land of\\nChanaan: and we pray thee to give orders that\\nwe thy servants may be in the land of Gessen.\\n5The king therefore said to Joseph: Thy fa-\\nther and thy brethren are come to thee.\\n6The land of Egypt is before thee: and make\\nthem dwell in the best place, and give them the\\nland of Gessen. And if thou knowest that there\\nare industrious men among them, make them\\nrulers over my cattle.\\n7After this Joseph brought in his father to\\nthe king, and presented him before him: and he\\nblessed him.\\n8And being asked by him: How many are the\\ndays of the years of thy life?\\n9He answered: The days of my pilgrimage\\nare a hundred and thirty years, few, and evil,\\nand they are not come up to the days of the\\npilgrimage of my fathers.\\n10And blessing the king, he went out.\\n11But Joseph gave a possession to his fa-\\nther and his brethren in Egypt, in the best place\\nof the land, in Ramesses, as Pharao had com-\\nmanded.\\n12And he nourished them, and all his father's\\nhouse, allowing food to every one.\\n13For in the whole world there was want\\nof bread, and a famine had oppressed the land,\\nmore especially of Egypt and Chanaan;\\n14Out of which he gathered up all the money\\nfor the corn which they bought, and brought it\\nin to the king's treasure.\\n15And when the buyers wanted money, all\\nEgypt came to Joseph, saying: Give us bread:\\nwhy should we die in thy presence, having now\\nno money?\\n16And he answered them: Bring me your cat-\\ntle, and for them I will give you food, if you have\\nno money.\\n17And when they had brought them, he gave\\nthem food in exchange for their horses, and\\nsheep, and oxen, and asses: and he maintained\\nthem that year for the exchange of their cattle.18And they came the second year, and said\\nto him: We will not hide from our lord, how that\\nour money is spent, and our cattle also are gone:\\nneither art thou ignorant that we have nothing\\nnow left but our bodies and our lands.\\n19Why therefore shall we die before thy eyes?\\nwe will be thine, both we and our lands: buy\\nus to be the king's servants, and give us seed,\\nlest for want of tillers the land be turned into a\\nwilderness.\\n20So Joesph bought all the land of Egypt,\\nevery man selling his possessions, because of the\\ngreatness of the famine. And he brought it into\\nPharao's hands:\\n21And all its people from one end of the bor-\\nders of Egypt, even to the other end thereof,\\n22Except the land of the priests, which had\\nbeen given them by the king: to whom also a\\ncertain allowance of food was given out of the\\npublic stores, and therefore they were not forced\\nto sell their possessions.\\n23Then Joseph said to the people: Behold,\\nas you see, both you and your lands belong to\\nPharao; take seed and sow the \\x0celds,\\n24That you may have corn. The \\x0cfth part\\nyou shall give to the king; the other four you\\nshall have for seed, and for food for your families\\nand children.\\n25And they answered: our life is in thy hand;\\nonly let my lord look favourably upon us, and we\\nwill gladly serve the king.\\n26From that time unto this day, in the whole\\nland of Egypt, the \\x0cfth part is paid to the kings,\\nand it is become as a law, except the land of the\\npriests, which was free from this covenant.\\n27So Israel dwelt in Egypt, that is, in the\\nland of Gessen, and possessed it; and grew, and\\nwas multiplied exceedingly.\\n28And he lived in it seventeen years: and all\\nthe days of his life came to a hundred and forty-\\nseven years.\\n29And when he saw that the day of his death\\ndrew nigh, he called his son Joseph, and said\\nto him: If I have found favour in thy sight, put\\nthy hand under my thigh; and thou shalt shew\\nme this kindness and truth, not to bury me in\\nEgypt.\\n30But I will sleep with my fathers, and thou\\nshalt take me away out of this land, and bury\\nme in the burying place of my ancestors. And\\nJoseph answered him: I will do what thou hast\\ncommanded.\\n31And he said: Swear then to me. And as he\\nwas swearing, Israel adored God, turning to the\\nbed's head.\\nChapter 48\\nAfter these things, it was told Joseph that his\\nfather was sick; and he set out to go to him,\\ntaking his two sons Manasses and Ephraim.\\n2And it was told the old man: Behold thy son\\nJoseph cometh to thee. And being strengthened,\\nhe sat on his bed.\\n3And when Joseph was come in to him, he\\nsaid: God almighty apppeared to me at Luza,\\nwhich is in the land of Chanaan, and he blessed\\nme,\\n4And said: I will cause thee to increase and\\nmultiply, and I will make of thee a multitude of\\npeople: and I will give this land to thee, and to\\nthy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.\\n5So thy two sons, who were born to thee in\\nthe land of Egypt before I came hither to thee,\\nshall be mine: Ephraim and Manasses shall be\\nreputed to me as Ruben and Simeon.\\n6But the rest whom thou shalt have after\\nthem, shall be thine, and shall be called by the\\nname of their brethren in their possessions.7For, when I came out of Mesopotamia,\\nRachel died from me in the land of Chanaan in\\nthe very journey, and it was spring time: and I\\nwas going to Ephrata, and I buried her near the\\nway of Ephrata, which by another name is called\\nBethlehem.\\n8Then seeing his sons, he said to him: Who\\nare these?\\n9He answered: They are my sons, whom God\\nhath given me in this place. And he said: Bring\\nthem to me, that I may bless them.\\n10For Israel's eyes were dim by reason of his\\ngreat age, and he could not see clearly. And\\nwhen they were brought to him, he kissed and\\nembraced them,\\n11And said to his son: I am not deprived of\\nseeing thee; moreover God hath shewn me thy\\nseed.\\n12And when Joseph had taken them from his\\nfather's lap, he bowed down with his face to the\\nground.\\n13And he set Ephraim on his right hand, that\\nis, towards the left hand of Israel; but Manasses\\non his left hand, to wit, towards his father's right\\nhand, and brought them near to him.\\n14But he, stretching forth his right hand,\\nput it upon the head of Ephraim, the younger\\nbrother; and the left upon the head of Manasses,\\nwho was the elder, changing his hands.\\n15And Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph, and\\nsaid: God, in whose sight my fathers Abraham\\nand Isaac walked, God that feedeth me from my\\nyouth until this day:\\n16The angel that delivereth me from all evils,\\nbless these boys: and let my name be called upon\\nthem, and the names of my fathers Abraham and\\nIsaac; and may they grow into a multitude upon\\nthe earth.\\n17And Joseph seeing that his father had put\\nhis right hand upon the head of Ephraim, was\\nmuch displeased: and taking his father's hand,\\nhe tried to lift it from Ephraim's head, and to\\nremove it to the head of Manasses.\\n18And he said to his father: It should not be\\nso, my father; for this is the \\x0crstborn, put thy\\nright hand upon his head.\\n19But he refusing, said: I know, my son, I\\nknow: and this also shall become a people, and\\nshall be multiplied; but his younger brother shall\\nbe greater than he; and his seed shall grow into\\nnations.\\n20And he blessed them at that time, saying:\\nIn thee shall Israel be blessed, and it shall be\\nsaid: God do to thee as to Ephraim, and as to\\nManasses. And he set Ephraim before Manasses.\\n21And he said to Joseph, his son: Behold I\\ndie, and God will be with you, and will bring\\nyou back into the land of your fathers.\\n22I give thee a portion above thy brethren,\\nwhich I took out of the hand of the Amorrhite\\nwith my sword and bow.\\nChapter 49\\nAnd Jacob called his sons, and said to them:\\nGather yourselves together, that I may tell you\\nthe things that shall befall you in the last days.\\n2Gather yourselves together, and hear, O ye\\nsons of Jacob, hearken to Israel, your father:\\n3Ruben, my \\x0crstborn, thou art my strength,\\nand the beginning of my sorrow; excelling in\\ngifts, greater in command.\\n4Thou art poured out as water, grow thou\\nnot; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed,\\nand didst de\\x0cle his couch.\\n5Simeon and Levi brethren: vessels of iniq-\\nuity waging war.\\n6Let not my soul go into their counsel, nor\\nmy glory be in their assembly: because in theirfury they slew a man, and in their selfwill they\\nundermined a wall.\\n7Cursed be their fury, because it was stub-\\nborn: and their wrath, because it was cruel: I\\nwill divide them in Jacob, and will scatter them\\nin Israel.\\n8Juda, thee shall thy brethren praise: thy\\nhand shall be on the necks of thy enemies; the\\nsons of thy father shall bow down to thee.\\n9Juda is a lion's whelp: to the prey, my son,\\nthou art gone up: resting thou hast couched as\\na lion, and as a lioness, who shall rouse him?\\n10The sceptre shall not be taken away from\\nJuda, nor a ruler from his thigh, till he come that\\nis to be sent, and he shall be the expectation of\\nnations.\\n11Tying his foal to the vineyard, and his ass,\\nO my son, to the vine. He shall wash his robe in\\nwine, and his garment in the blood of the grape.\\n12His eyes are more beautiful than wine, and\\nhis teeth whiter than milk.\\n13Zabulon shall dwell on the seashore, and in\\nthe road of ships, reaching as far as Sidon.\\n14Issachar shall be a strong ass, lying down\\nbetween the borders.\\n15He saw rest that it was good: and the land\\nthat it was excellent: and he bowed his shoulder\\nto carry, and became a servant under tribute.\\n16Dan shall judge his people like another\\ntribe in Israel.\\n17Let Dan be a snake in the way, a serpent\\nin the path, that biteth the horse's heels, that\\nhis rider may fall backward.\\n18I will look for thy salvation, O Lord.\\n19Gad, being girded, shall \\x0cght before him:\\nand he himself shall be girded backward.\\n20Aser, his bread shall be fat, and he shall\\nyield dainties to kings.\\n21Nephthali, a hart let loose, and giving\\nwords of beauty.\\n22Joseph is a growing son, a growing son and\\ncomely to behold: the daughters run to and fro\\nupon the wall;\\n23But they that held darts, provoked him,\\nand quarrelled with him, and envied him.\\n24His bow rested upon the strong, and the\\nbands of his arms and his hands were loosed, by\\nthe hands of the mighty one of Jacob: thence he\\ncame forth a pastor, the stone of Israel.\\n25The God of thy father shall be thy helper,\\nand the Almighty shall bless thee with the bless-\\nings of heaven above, with the blessings of the\\ndeep that lieth beneath, with the blessings of the\\nbreasts and of the womb.\\n26The blessings of thy father are strength-\\nened with the blessings of his fathers: until the\\ndesire of the everlasting hills should come: may\\nthey be upon the head of Joseph, and upon the\\ncrown of the Nazarite among his brethren.\\n27Benjamin a ravenous wolf, in the morning\\nshall eat the prey, and in the evening shall divide\\nthe spoil.\\n28All these are the twelve tribes of Israel:\\nthese things their father spoke to them, and he\\nblessed every one with their proper blessings.\\n29And he charged them, saying: I am now\\ngoing to be gathered to my people: bury me with\\nmy fathers in the double cave, which is in the\\n\\x0celd of Ephron the Hethite,\\n30Over against Mambre, in the land of\\nChanaan, which Abraham bought together with\\nthe \\x0celd, of Ephron the Hethite, for a possession\\nto bury in.\\n31There they buried him, and Sara his wife:\\nthere was Isaac buried with Rebecca, his wife:\\nthere also Lia doth lie buried.\\n32And when he had ended the command-\\nments, wherewith he instructed his sons, he drew\\nup his feet upon the bed, and died: and he was\\ngathered to his people.Chapter 50\\nAnd when Joseph saw this, he fell upon his fa-\\nther's face, weeping and kissing him.\\n2And he commanded his servants, the physi-\\ncians, to embalm his father.\\n3And while they were ful\\x0clling his commands,\\nthere passed forty days: for this was the man-\\nner with bodies that were embalmed, and Egypt\\nmourned for him seventy days.\\n4And the time of the mourning being expired,\\nJoseph spoke to the family of Pharao: If I have\\nfound favour in your sight, speak in the ears of\\nPharao:\\n5For my father made me swear to him, saying:\\nBehold I die; thou shalt bury me in my sepulchre\\nwhich I have digged for myself in the land of\\nChanaan. So I will go up and bury my father,\\nand return.\\n6And Pharao said to him: Go up and bury\\nthy father according as he made thee swear.\\n7So he went up, and there went with him all\\nthe ancients of Pharao's house, and all the elders\\nof the land of Egypt.\\n8And the house of Joseph with his brethren,\\nexcept their children, and their \\rocks and herds,\\nwhich they left in the land of Gessen.\\n9He had also in his train chariots and horse-\\nmen: and it was a great company.\\n10And they came to the threshing \\roor\\nof Atad, which is situated beyond the Jordan:\\nwhere celebrating the exequies with a great and\\nvehement lamentation, they spent full seven\\ndays.\\n11And when the inhabitants of Chanaan saw\\nthis, they said: This is a great mourning to the\\nEgyptians. And therefore the name of that place\\nwas called, The mourning of Egypt.\\n12So the sons of Jacob did as he had com-\\nmanded them.\\n13And carrying him into the land of\\nChanaan, they buried him in the double cave,\\nwhich Abraham had bought together with the\\n\\x0celd for a possession of a burying place, of Eh-\\npron, the Hethite, over against Mambre.\\n14And Joseph returned into Egypt with his\\nbrethren, and all that were in his company, after\\nhe had buried his father.\\n15Now he being dead, his brethren were\\nafraid, and talked one with another: Lest per-\\nhaps he should remember the wrong he su\\x0bered,\\nand requite us all the evil that we did to him.\\n16And they sent a message to him, saying:\\nThy father commanded us before he died,\\n17That we should say thus much to thee from\\nhim: I beseech thee to forget the wickedness of\\nthy brethren, and the sin and malice they prac-\\ntised against thee: we also pray thee, to forgive\\nthe servants of the God of thy father this wicked-\\nness. And when Joseph heard this, he wept.\\n18And his brethren came to him; and wor-\\nshipping prostrate on the ground, they said: We\\nare thy servants.\\n19And he answered them: Fear not: can we\\nresist the will of God?\\n20You thought evil against me: but God\\nturned it into good, that he might exalt me, as\\nat present you see, and might save many people.\\n21Fear not: I will feed you and your children.\\nAnd he comforted them, and spoke gently and\\nmildly.\\n22And he dwelt in Egypt with all his father's\\nhouse; and lived a hundred and ten years. And\\nhe saw the children of Ephraim to the third gen-\\neration. The children also of Machir, the sons of\\nManasses, were born on Joseph's knees.\\n23After which he told his brethren: God will\\nvisit you after my death, and will make you go\\nup out of this land, to the land which he swore\\nto Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.24And he made them swear to him, saying:\\nGod will visit you, carry my bones with you out\\nof this place:\\n25And he died, being a hundred and ten years\\nold. And being embalmed, he was laid in a co\\x0en\\nin Egypt.\\n\""
